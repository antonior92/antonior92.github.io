	abstract = {Modern neural networks are expected to simultaneously satisfy a host of desirable properties: accurate fitting to training data, generalization to unseen inputs, parameter and computational efficiency, and robustness to adversarial perturbations. While compressibility and robustness have each been studied extensively, a unified understanding of their interaction still remains elusive. In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how different forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral compressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of compression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the representation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective perturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound, revealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact \$L\_{\textbackslash}infty\$ and \$L\_2\$ robustness via their effects on the learned representations. Crucially, the vulnerabilities we identify arise irrespective of how compression is achieved - whether via regularization, architectural bias, or implicit learning dynamics. Through empirical evaluations across synthetic and realistic tasks, we confirm our theoretical predictions, and further demonstrate that these vulnerabilities persist under adversarial training and transfer learning, and contribute to the emergence of universal adversarial perturbations. Our findings show a fundamental tension between structured compressibility and robustness, and suggest new pathways for designing models that are both efficient and secure.},

In the field of physiological time series analysis, we propose a fine-tuning framework that leverages multiple small annotated datasets from diverse domains to improve out-of-distribution generalization performance (OOD-GP). Through an ablation study, we demonstrate the performance of our framework by evaluating the role of incorporating a greater number of independent datasets for tine-tuning to improve OOD-GP. Our experiments involve thirteen publicly available ECG and EEG datasets across four distinct tasks. In addition, we develop a method to measure the alignment of the latent space of target domains. We use this method to interpret our results, suggesting that multi-source domain training facilitates the learning of robust cross-domain features while minimizing learning of shortcut features. To support further research, we provide reproducible source code, establishing a framework and benchmark for studies on OOD-GP [URL provided upon publication.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) models have shown outstanding performance in diagnostic and prognostic tasks, yet their black-box nature hampers clinical adoption. Meanwhile, a growing demand for explainable AI in medicine underscores the need for transparent, trustworthy decision-making. Moving beyond post-hoc explainability techniques that have shown unreliable results, we focus on explicit representation learning using variational autoencoders (VAE) to capture inherently interpretable ECG features. While VAEs have demonstrated potential for ECG interpretability, the presumed performance-explainability trade-off remains underexplored, with many studies relying on complex, non-linear methods that obscure the morphological information of the features. In this work, we present a novel framework (VAE-SCAN) to model bi-directional, interpretable associations between ECG features and clinical factors. We also investigate how different representations affect ECG decoding performance across models with varying levels of explainability. Our findings demonstrate the cost introduced by intrinsic ECG interpretability, based on which we discuss potential implications and directions.},

Chronic Chagas disease can cause cardiovascular diseases and digestive problems. Serological testing capacities for Chagas disease are limited, but Chagas cardiomyopathy often manifests in ECGs, providing an opportunity to prioritize patients for testing and treatment. Approach: The George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2025 invites teams to develop algorithmic approaches for identifying Chagas disease from electrocardiograms (ECGs). Main results: This Challenge provides multiple innovations. First, we leveraged several datasets with labels from patient reports and serological testing, provided a large dataset with weak labels and smaller datasets with strong labels. Second, we augmented the data to support model robustness and generalizability to unseen data sources. Third, we applied an evaluation metric that captured the local serological testing capacity for Chagas disease to frame the machine learning problem as a triage task. Significance: Over 630 participants from 111 teams submitted over 1300 entries during the Challenge, representing diverse approaches from academia and industry worldwide.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the most widespread cause of death across the world, and this aspect requires a better risk stratification method. Effectively, this paper tests the potential of the artificial intelligence (AI)-predicted electrocardiogram (ECG) age as a novel CVD risk predictor biomarker. We used the CODE-15~\% data (over 344,000 ECG records with clinical annotation) to create a logistic regression model that incorporated age predicted from ECG, as well as demographic and comorbidity variables, to evaluate cardiovascular outcomes. The model performed better with ECG-predicted age than using chronological age alone, with a 92~\% receiver operating characteristic curve area (AUROC) for atrial fibrillation (AF) detection, compared to 88~\% when chronological age was used alone. From the results, the ECG-predicted age showed a stronger correlation with AF (r~=~0.17), bundle branch blocks (r~=~0.14), and Chagas disease (r~=~0.074) than chronological age. Sex-specific patterns were also observed; male sex had an increased risk of sinus bradycardia (odds ratio [OR]: 3.090), while female sex had a lower risk of having a left bundle branch block (LBBB) OR: 0.885) with the variable of ECG-predicted age. These results demonstrate how ECG-predicted age may be used as a biologically meaningful indicator for cardiovascular risk assessment. This study advances personalized medicine by offering a cost-effective and scalable method for detecting CVD, particularly in under-resourced regions that lack conventional biomarkers.},

	abstract = {The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a major diagnostic test for cardiovascular diseases and enhanced automated analysis tools might lead to more reliable diagnosis and improved clinical practice. Deep neural networks are models composed of stacked transformations that learn tasks by examples. Inspired by the success of these models in computer vision, we propose an end-to-end approach for the task at hand. We trained deep convolutional neural network models in the heterogeneous dataset provided in the Physionet 2020 Challenge and used an ensemble of seven of these convolutional models for the classification of abnormalities present in the ECG records. Ensembles use the output of multiple models to generate a combined prediction and are known to improve performance and generalization when compared to the individual models. In our submission, we use an ensemble of neural networks with the architecture similar to the one described in Nat Commun 11, 1760 (2020) for 12-lead ECGs classification. On the partially hidden test dataset from the challenge, the best-scored entry for our team (the ``Code Team'') had a performance of 0.657, which place us in the 7-th place team-wise in the challenge leaderboard.},

Our method focuses exclusively on automated ECG diagnosis and analyzes the explanation in terms of clinical accuracy for interpretability and robustness. The proposed method uses a noise-insertion strategy to quantify the impact of intervals and segments of the ECG signals on the automated classification outcome. An ECG segmentation method was applied to ECG tracings, to obtain: (1) Intervals, Segments and Axis; (2) Rate, and (3) Rhythm. Noise was added to the signal to disturb the ECG features in a realistic way. The method was tested using Monte Carlo simulation and the feature impact is estimated by the change in the model prediction averaged over 499 executions and a feature is defined as important if its mean value changes the result of the classifier. We demonstrate our method by explaining diagnoses generated by a deep convolutional neural network. The proposed method is particularly effective and useful for modern deep learning models that take raw data as input.},

Here, we propose a self-supervised learning method for 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). For pretraining the model we design a task to mask out subsegements of all channels of the input signals and try to predict the actual values. As the model architecture, we use a U-ResNet containing an encoder-decoder structure. We test our method by self-supervised pretraining on the CODE dataset and then transfer the learnt features by finetuning on the PTB-XL and CPSC benchmarks to evaluate the effect of our method in the classification of 12-leads ECGs. The method does provide modest improvements in performance when compared to not using pretraining. In future work we will make use of these ideas in smaller dataset, where we believe it can lead to larger performance gains.},

An electronic cohort was obtained linking data from ECG exams and those from a national mortality information system, using standard probabilistic linkage methods. We considered only the first ECG of each patient. Patients under 16 years were excluded. Hazard ratios (HR) for mortality were adjusted for demographic and self-reported clinical factors and estimated with Cox regression.
Results: From a dataset of 1,773,689 patients, 1,558,421 were included, mean age 51.6 years; 40.2\% male. There were 3.34\% deaths from all causes in 3.68 years of median follow up. The prevalence of AF was 1.33\%. AF was an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality (HR 2.10, 95\%CI 2.03--2.17) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.06, 95\%CI 1.86--2.29). Females with AF had a higher risk of overall and cardiovascular mortality compared with males (p {\textless} 0.001).
Conclusions: AF was a strong predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in a primary care population, with increased risk in women.},

This study delves into the influence of training data characteristics on the generalization performance of models, specifically in cardiac abnormality detection. Materials \& methods: Leveraging diverse electrocardiogram datasets, models are trained on subsets with varying characteristics and subsequently compared for performance. Additionally, the introduction of the attention mechanism aims to improve generalizability. Results: Experiments reveal that using a balanced dataset, just 1\% of a large dataset, leads to equal performance in generalization tasks, notably in detecting cardiology abnormalities. Conclusion: This balanced training data notably enhances model generalizability, while the integration of the attention mechanism further refines the model's ability to generalize effectively. This study tackles a common problem for deep learning models: they often struggle when faced with new, unfamiliar data that they have not~been trained on. This phenomenon is also known as performance drop in out-of-distribution generalization. This reduced performance on out-of-distribution generalization is a key focus of the research, aiming to improve the models'~ability to handle diverse data sets beyond their training data. The study examines how the characteristics of the dataset used to train deep learning models affect their ability to detect abnormal heart activities when applied to new, unseen data. Researchers trained these models using various sets of electrocardiogram~(ECG)~data and then evaluated their performance in identifying abnormalities. They also introduced an attention mechanism to enhance the models'~learning capabilities. The attention mechanism in deep learning is like a spotlight that helps the model focus on important information while ignoring less relevant details. The findings were particularly noteworthy. Despite being trained on a small, well-balanced subset of a larger dataset, the models excelled in detecting heart abnormalities in new, unfamiliar data. This training method significantly improved the models'~generalization and performance with unseen data. Furthermore, integrating the attention mechanism substantially enhanced the models'~ability to generalize effectively on new information. Investigate the impact of training data characteristics and attention mechanism on deep learning model generalizability in cardiac abnormality detection. Balanced dataset (1\% of the total) improves model performance in generalization tasks, especially in detecting cardiology abnormalities. The attention mechanism further enhances the model's capacity to comprehend and utilize out-of-distribution data effectively. Utilized multiple electrocardiogram datasets for the study. Trained models on subsets with varying characteristics and evaluated performance. Added attention mechanism to enhance learning capabilities. Balanced training data significantly enhances model generalizability. Attention mechanism improves the model's ability to generalize on out-of-distribution data. Lack of clinical user information in datasets due to privacy and ethical considerations. Future research may consider patient-specific models for improved generalization in biomedical machine learning. Balanced and curated datasets are crucial for training high-performing models in cardiac abnormality detection using deep learning. Attention mechanisms show promise in enhancing model accuracy and generalization.},

	abstract = {Background
Females are typically underserved in cardiovascular medicine. The use of sex as a dichotomous variable for risk stratification fails to capture the heterogeneity of risk within each sex. We aimed to develop an artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiography (AI-ECG) model to investigate sex-specific cardiovascular risk.
Methods
In this retrospective cohort study, we trained a convolutional neural network to classify sex using the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). The Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) secondary care dataset, comprising data from individuals who had clinically indicated ECGs performed in a hospital setting in Boston, MA, USA collected between May, 2000, and March, 2023, was the derivation cohort (1 163 401 ECGs). 50\% of this dataset was used for model training, 10\% for validation, and 40\% for testing. External validation was performed using the UK Biobank cohort, comprising data from volunteers aged 40--69 years at the time of enrolment in 2006--10 (42 386 ECGs). We examined the difference between AI-ECG-predicted sex (continuous) and biological sex (dichotomous), termed sex discordance score.
Findings
AI-ECG accurately identified sex (area under the receiver operating characteristic 0\textperiodcentered{}943 [95\% CI 0\textperiodcentered{}942--0\textperiodcentered{}943] for BIDMC and 0\textperiodcentered{}971 [0\textperiodcentered{}969--0\textperiodcentered{}972] for the UK Biobank). In BIDMC outpatients with normal ECGs, an increased sex discordance score was associated with covariate-adjusted increased risk of cardiovascular death in females (hazard ratio [HR] 1\textperiodcentered{}78 [95\% CI 1\textperiodcentered{}18--2\textperiodcentered{}70], p=0\textperiodcentered{}006) but not males (1\textperiodcentered{}00 [0\textperiodcentered{}63--1\textperiodcentered{}58], p=0\textperiodcentered{}996). In the UK Biobank cohort, the same pattern was seen (HR 1\textperiodcentered{}33 [95\% CI 1\textperiodcentered{}06--1\textperiodcentered{}68] for females, p=0\textperiodcentered{}015; 0\textperiodcentered{}98 [0\textperiodcentered{}80--1\textperiodcentered{}20] for males, p=0\textperiodcentered{}854). Females with a higher sex discordance score were more likely to have future heart failure or myocardial infarction in the BIDMC cohort and had more male cardiac (increased left ventricular mass and chamber volumes) and non-cardiac phenotypes (increased muscle mass and reduced body fat percentage) in both cohorts.
Interpretation
Sex discordance score is a novel AI-ECG biomarker capable of identifying females with disproportionately elevated cardiovascular risk. AI-ECG has the potential to identify female patients who could benefit from enhanced risk factor modification or surveillance.

Cho et al., https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae790.Ageing is a complex, multifaceted process encompassing biological, physiological, and psychosocial changes occurring over time. At the cellular and molecular levels, ageing is characterized by accumulating damage in cells and tissues, leading to a progressive decline in the body's ability to maintain homeostasis and repair itself. This biological deterioration is not uniform across individuals or even within different organs of the same individual. While some organs may exhibit accelerated ageing, others might remain relatively preserved, highlighting the heterogeneity of the ageing process across the human body.1 The concept of `biological age' vs. `chronological age' is pivotal in understanding ageing. Chronological age is a simple measure of the years a person has lived, whereas biological age reflects the functional status and health of an individual's organs and systems. Individuals of the same chronological age may have vastly different biological ages due to genetic predisposition, lifestyle factors, and environmental exposures. This variation can significantly impact disease risk and mortality. Understanding and measuring organ-specific ageing can open up avenues for targeted interventions that could decelerate ageing in specific organs, thereby improving overall health and extending a healthy life span.2},

We analyze our DNN models on a novel dataset of over 290,000 ECGs across four major electrolytes and compare their performance with traditional machine learning models. For improved understanding, we also study the full spectrum from continuous predictions to a binary classification of extreme concentration levels. Finally, we investigate probabilistic regression approaches and explore uncertainty estimates for enhanced clinical usefulness. Our results show that DNNs outperform traditional models but model performance varies significantly across different electrolytes. While discretization leads to good classification performance, it does not address the original problem of continuous concentration level prediction. Probabilistic regression has practical potential, but our uncertainty estimates are not perfectly calibrated. Our study is therefore a first step towards developing an accurate and reliable ECG-based method for electrolyte concentration level prediction---a method with high potential impact within multiple clinical scenarios.},

	abstract = {Summary
Background
Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled electrocardiography (ECG) can be used to predict risk of future disease and mortality but has not yet been adopted into clinical practice. Existing model predictions do not have actionability at an individual patient level, explainability, or biological plausibi. We sought to address these limitations of previous AI-ECG approaches by developing the AI-ECG risk estimator (AIRE) platform.
Methods
The AIRE platform was developed in a secondary care dataset (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center [BIDMC]) of 1 163 401 ECGs from 189 539 patients with deep learning and a discrete-time survival model to create a patient-specific survival curve with a single ECG. Therefore, AIRE predicts not only risk of mortality, but also time-to-mortality. AIRE was validated in five diverse, transnational cohorts from the USA, Brazil, and the UK (UK Biobank [UKB]), including volunteers, primary care patients, and secondary care patients.
Findings
AIRE accurately predicts risk of all-cause mortality (BIDMC C-index 0\textperiodcentered{}775, 95\% CI 0\textperiodcentered{}773--0\textperiodcentered{}776; C-indices on external validation datasets 0\textperiodcentered{}638--0\textperiodcentered{}773), future ventricular arrhythmia (BIDMC C-index 0\textperiodcentered{}760, 95\% CI 0\textperiodcentered{}756--0\textperiodcentered{}763; UKB C-index 0\textperiodcentered{}719, 95\% CI 0\textperiodcentered{}635--0\textperiodcentered{}803), future atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (0\textperiodcentered{}696, 0\textperiodcentered{}694--0\textperiodcentered{}698; 0\textperiodcentered{}643, 0\textperiodcentered{}624--0\textperiodcentered{}662), and future heart failure (0\textperiodcentered{}787, 0\textperiodcentered{}785--0\textperiodcentered{}789; 0\textperiodcentered{}768, 0\textperiodcentered{}733--0\textperiodcentered{}802). Through phenome-wide and genome-wide association studies, we identified candidate biological pathways for the prediction of increased risk, including changes in cardiac structure and function, and genes associated with cardiac structure, biological ageing, and metabolic syndrome.
Interpretation
AIRE is an actionable, explainable, and biologically plausible AI-ECG risk estimation platform that has the potential for use worldwide across a wide range of clinical contexts for short-term and long-term risk estimation.

However, the use of artificial intelligence to advance these medical practices and learn new clinical insights from ECGs remains largely unexplored. Utilising a dataset of 2,322,513 ECGs collected from 1,558,772 patients with 7 years of follow-up, we developed a deep learning model with state-of-the-art granularity for the interpretable diagnosis of cardiac abnormalities, gender identification, and hyper- tension screening solely from ECGs, which are then used to stratify the risk of mortality. The model achieved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.998 (95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.995-0.999), 0.964 (0.963-0.965), and 0.839 (0.837-0.841) for the three diagnostic tasks separately. Using ECG-predicted results, we find high risks of mortality for subjects with sinus tachycardia (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 2.24, 1.96-2.57), and atrial fibrillation (adjusted HR of 2.22, 1.99-2.48). We further use salient morphologies produced by the deep learning model to identify key ECG leads that achieved similar performance for the three diagnoses, and we find that the V1 ECG lead is important for hypertension screening and mortality risk stratification of hypertensive cohorts, with an AUC of 0.816 (0.814-0.818) and a univariate HR of 1.70 (1.61-1.79) for the two tasks separately. Using ECGs alone, our developed model showed cardiologist-level accuracy in interpretable cardiac diagnosis, and the advancement in mortality risk stratification; In addition, the potential to facilitate clinical knowledge discovery for gender and hypertension detection which are not readily available.},

	abstract = {The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most commonly used exam for the screening and evaluation of cardiovascular diseases. Here we propose that the age predicted by artificial intelligence (AI) from the raw ECG tracing (ECG-age) can be a measure of cardiovascular health and provide prognostic information. A deep convolutional neural network was trained to predict a patient9s age from the 12-lead ECG using data from patients that underwent an ECG from 2010 to 2017 - the CODE study cohort (n=1,558,415 patients). On the 15\% hold-out CODE test split, patients with ECG-age more than 8 years greater than chronological age had a higher mortality rate (hazard ratio (HR) 1.79, p\&lt;0.001) in a mean follow-up of 3.67 years, whereas those with ECG-age more than 8 years less than chronological age had a lower mortality rate (HR 0.78, p\&lt;0.001). Similar results were obtained in the external cohorts ELSA-Brasil (n=14,236) and SaMi-Trop (n=1,631). The ability to predict mortality from the ECG predicted age remains even when we adjust the model for cardiovascular risk factors. Moreover, even for apparent normal ECGs, having a predicted ECG-age 8 or more years greater than chronological age remained a statistically significant predictor of risk (HR 1.53, p\&lt;0.001 in CODE 15\% test split). These results show that AI-enabled analysis of the ECG can add prognostic information to the interpretation of the 12-lead ECGs.},

	doi = {10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.062646},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND:
Left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction is associated with a {\textgreater}8-fold increased risk of heart failure and a 2-fold risk of premature death. The use of ECG signals in screening for LV systolic dysfunction is limited by their availability to clinicians. We developed a novel deep learning--based approach that can use ECG images for the screening of LV systolic dysfunction.

METHODS:
Using 12-lead ECGs plotted in multiple different formats, and corresponding echocardiographic data recorded within 15 days from the Yale New Haven Hospital between 2015 and 2021, we developed a convolutional neural network algorithm to detect an LV ejection fraction {\textless}40\%. The model was validated within clinical settings at Yale New Haven Hospital and externally on ECG images from Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, CA; Lake Regional Hospital in Osage Beach, MO; Memorial Hermann Southeast Hospital in Houston, TX; and Methodist Cardiology Clinic of San Antonio, TX. In addition, it was validated in the prospective Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping was used to localize class-discriminating signals in ECG images.

RESULTS:
Overall, 385 601 ECGs with paired echocardiograms were used for model development. The model demonstrated high discrimination power across various ECG image formats and calibrations in internal validation (area under receiving operation characteristics [AUROCs], 0.91; area under precision-recall curve [AUPRC], 0.55); and external sets of ECG images from Cedars Sinai (AUROC, 0.90 and AUPRC, 0.53), outpatient Yale New Haven Hospital clinics (AUROC, 0.94 and AUPRC, 0.77), Lake Regional Hospital (AUROC, 0.90 and AUPRC, 0.88), Memorial Hermann Southeast Hospital (AUROC, 0.91 and AUPRC 0.88), Methodist Cardiology Clinic (AUROC, 0.90 and AUPRC, 0.74), and Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health cohort (AUROC, 0.95 and AUPRC, 0.45). An ECG suggestive of LV systolic dysfunction portended a {\textgreater}27-fold higher odds of LV systolic dysfunction on transthoracic echocardiogram (odds ratio, 27.5 [95\% CI, 22.3--33.9] in the held-out set). Class-discriminative patterns localized to the anterior and anteroseptal leads (V2 to V3), corresponding to the left ventricle regardless of the ECG layout. A positive ECG screen in individuals with an LV ejection fraction $\geq$40\% at the time of initial assessment was associated with a 3.9-fold increased risk of developing incident LV systolic dysfunction in the future (hazard ratio, 3.9 [95\% CI, 3.3--4.7]; median follow-up, 3.2 years).

CONCLUSIONS:
We developed and externally validated a deep learning model that identifies LV systolic dysfunction from ECG images. This approach represents an automated and accessible screening strategy for LV systolic dysfunction, particularly in low-resource settings.},

Then, we exploit the fact that the nonlinear transformation is invertible in a certain subdomain. Hence, the name invertible kernel PCA (ikPCA) .

We provide bounds of the error in terms of the traditional risk and the parameter norm and show how these bounds can be leveraged and make it possible to use analysis from non-adversarial setups to study the adversarial risk. The usefulness of these results is illustrated by shedding light on whether or not overparameterized linear models can be adversarially robust. We show that adding features to linear models might be either a source of additional robustness or brittleness. We show that these differences appear due to scaling and how the \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$ and \${\textbackslash}ell\_2\$ norms of random projections concentrate. We also show how the reformulation we propose allows for solving adversarial training as a convex optimization problem. This is then used as a tool to study how adversarial training and other regularization methods might affect the robustness of the estimated models.},

This fact is then used to show that \${\textbackslash}ell\_{\textbackslash}infty\$-adversarial training produces sparse solutions and has many similarities to the lasso method. Similarly, \${\textbackslash}ell\_2\$-adversarial training has similarities with ridge regression. We use a robust regression framework to analyze and understand these similarities and also point to some differences. Finally, we show how adversarial training behaves differently from other regularization methods when estimating overparameterized models (i.e., models with more parameters than datapoints). It minimizes a sum of three terms which regularizes the solution, but unlike lasso and ridge regression, it can sharply transition into an interpolation mode. We show that for sufficiently many features or sufficiently small regularization parameters, the learned model perfectly interpolates the training data while still exhibiting good out-of-sample performance.},

	abstract = {Objective: Over the past few years, deep learning (DL) has been used extensively in research for 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. However, it is unclear whether the explicit or implicit claims made on DL superiority to the more classical feature engineering (FE) approaches, based on domain knowledge, hold. In addition, it remains unclear whether combining DL with FE may improve performance over a single modality. Methods: To address these research gaps and in-line with recent major experiments, we revisited three tasks: cardiac arrhythmia diagnosis (multiclass-multilabel classification), atrial fibrillation risk prediction (binary classification), and age estimation (regression). We used an overall dataset of 2.3M 12-lead ECG recordings to train the following models for each task: i) a random forest taking FE as input; ii) an end-to-end DL model; and iii) a merged model of FE+DL. Results: FE yielded comparable results to DL while necessitating significantly less data for the two classification tasks. DL outperformed FE for the regression task. For all tasks, merging FE with DL did not improve performance over DL alone. These findings were confirmed on the additional PTB-XL dataset. Conclusion: We found that for traditional 12-lead ECG based diagnosis tasks, DL did not yield a meaningful improvement over FE, while it improved significantly the nontraditional regression task. We also found that combining FE with DL did not improve over DL alone, which suggests that the FE were redundant with the features learned by DL. Significance: Our findings provides important recommendations on 12-lead ECG based machine learning strategy and data regime to choose for a given task. When looking at maximizing performance as the end goal, if the task is nontraditional and a large dataset is available then DL is preferable. If the task is a classical one and/or a small dataset is available then a FE approach may be the better choice.},

	abstract = {Myocardial infarction diagnosis is a common challenge in the emergency department. In managed settings, deep learning-based models and especially convolutional deep models have shown promise in electrocardiogram (ECG) classification, but there is a lack of high-performing models for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction in real-world scenarios. We aimed to train and validate a deep learning model using ECGs to predict myocardial infarction in real-world emergency department patients. We studied emergency department patients in the Stockholm region between 2007 and 2016 that had an ECG obtained because of their presenting complaint. We developed a deep neural network based on convolutional layers similar to a residual network. Inputs to the model were ECG tracing, age, and sex; and outputs were the probabilities of three mutually exclusive classes: non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and control status, as registered in the SWEDEHEART and other registries. We used an ensemble of five models. Among 492,226 ECGs in 214,250 patients, 5,416 were recorded with an NSTEMI, 1,818 a STEMI, and 485,207 without a myocardial infarction. In a random test set, our model could discriminate STEMIs/NSTEMIs from controls with a C-statistic of 0.991/0.832 and had a Brier score of 0.001/0.008. The model obtained a similar performance in a temporally separated test set of the study sample, and achieved a C-statistic of 0.985 and a Brier score of 0.002 in discriminating STEMIs from controls in an external test set. We developed and validated a deep learning model with excellent performance in discriminating between control, STEMI, and NSTEMI on the presenting ECG of a real-world sample of the important population of all-comers to the emergency department. Hence, deep learning models for ECG decision support could be valuable in the emergency department.},

	abstract = {Neural network models for dynamic systems can be trained either in parallel or in series-parallel configurations. Influenced by early arguments, several papers justify the choice of series-parallel rather than parallel configuration claiming it has a lower computational cost, better stability properties during training and provides more accurate results. Other published results, on the other hand, defend parallel training as being more robust and capable of yielding more accurate long-term predictions. The main contribution of this paper is to present a study comparing both methods under the same unified framework with special attention to three aspects: (i)~robustness of the estimation in the presence of noise; (ii)~computational cost; and, (iii)~convergence. A unifying mathematical framework and simulation studies show situations where each training method provides superior validation results and suggest that parallel training is generally better in more realistic scenarios. An example using measured data seems to reinforce such a claim. Complexity analysis and numerical examples show that both methods have similar computational cost although series-parallel training is more amenable to parallelization. Some informal discussion about stability and convergence properties is presented and explored in the examples.},

Median and interquartile of age for the recordings were 58 (46-69) and 38\% of the patients were males. Recordings were assigned to train-validation and test sets in an 80:20\% split which was stratified by class, age and gender. A random forest classifier was trained to predict, for a given recording, the risk of AF development within 5-years. We use features obtained from different modalities, namely demographics, clinical information, engineered features, and features from deep representation learning.The best model performance on the test set was obtained for the model combining features from all modalities with an AUROC=0.909 against the best single modality model which had an AUROC=0.839.Our study has important clinical implications for AF management. It is the first study integrating feature engineering, deep learning and EMR metadata to create a risk prediction tool for the management of patients at risk of AF. The best model that includes features from all modalities demonstrates that human knowledge in electrophysiology combined with deep learning outperforms any single modality approach. The high performance obtained suggest that structural changes in the 12-lead ECG are associated with existing or impending AF.},

Two established cohorts, ELSA-Brasil, of Brazilian public servants, and SaMi-Trop, of Chagas disease patients, were used for external validation. 2,322,513 ECGs from 1,558,421 patients over 16 years old that underwent an ECG from 2010 to 2017 were included. A deep convolutional neural network was trained in order to predict the age of the patient based solely on ECG 12-lead tracings. The ECG database was split into 85-15\% training and test datasets, respectively. Death was ascertained using probabilistic linkage with Brazil's mortality information data. The Cox regression model, adjusted by age and sex, was used for statistical analysis. The model was validated in two cohorts: ELSA-Brasil (n=14,263) and SaMi-Trop (n=1,631).Results: he mean predicted ECG-age was 52.0 years ($\pm$18.7) with a mean absolute error of 8.38 ($\pm$7.0) years. Patients with ECG-age {\textgreater}8y older than chronological age had higher mortality rate (HR 1.79, 95\%CI 1.69-1.90; p{\textless}0.001), whereas those ECG-age {\textgreater}8y younger than chronological age were associated with a lower mortality rate (HR 0.78, 95\%CI 0.74-0.83; p{\textless}0.001).

The present study describes the development and clinical applications of a large database of such digital ECGs, namely the CODE (Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiology) study. ECGs obtained by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais, Brazil, from 2010 to 17, were organized in a structured database. A hierarchical free-text machine learning algorithm recognized specific ECG diagnoses from cardiologist reports. The Glasgow ECG Analysis Program provided Minnesota Codes and automatic diagnostic statements. The presence of a specific ECG abnormality was considered when both automatic and medical diagnosis were concordant; cases of discordance were decided using heuristisc rules and manual review. The ECG database was linked to the national mortality information system using probabilistic linkage methods. From 2,470,424 ECGs, 1,773,689 patients were identified. After excluding the ECGs with technical problems and patients {\textless}16 years-old, 1,558,415 patients were studied. High performance measures were obtained using an end-to-end deep neural network trained to detect 6 types of ECG abnormalities, with F1 scores {\textgreater}80\% and specificity {\textgreater}99\% in an independent test dataset. We also evaluated the risk of mortality associated with the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF), which showed that AF was a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality and mortality for all causes, with increased risk in women.

	abstract = {We shed new light on the smoothness of optimization problems arising in prediction error parameter estimation of linear and nonlinear systems. We show that for regions of the parameter space where the model is not contractive, the Lipschitz constant and beta-smoothness of the objective function might blow up exponentially with the simulation length, making it hard to numerically find minima within those regions or, even, to escape from them. In addition to providing theoretical understanding of this problem, this paper also proposes the use of multiple shooting as a viable solution. The proposed method minimizes the error between a prediction model and the observed values. Rather than running the prediction model over the entire dataset, multiple shooting splits the data into smaller subsets and runs the prediction model over each subset, making the simulation length a design parameter and making it possible to solve problems that would be infeasible using a standard approach. The equivalence to the original problem is obtained by including constraints in the optimization. The new method is illustrated by estimating the parameters of nonlinear systems with chaotic or unstable behavior, as well as neural networks. We also present a comparative analysis of the proposed method with multi-step-ahead prediction error minimization.},

The major steps needed to estimate depth using a stereo camera were followed. They are: calibration (estimation of camera geometry and parameters), retification (aligning images), correspondence (finding correspondent points on the two images and the distance between them)
and reconstruction (estimation of features depth using triangulation). All algorithms needed were implemented using C++ and integrated to the prototype. The prototype is able to estimate depth in a range of 0.7 to 20 meters, it has a resolution on the order of a few centimeters and can reach a frame rate of 5 frames per second. The industrial camera v200 has all its internal processing computed by a FPGA. It is suggested, as a future work, to use the FPGA to speed up the retification and correspondence algorithms.

To achieve this, we consider the use of so-called energy-based models, which have been developed in allied fields for learning unknown distributions based on data. This energy-based model relies on a general function to describe the distribution, and here we consider a deep neural network for this purpose. The primary benefit of this approach is that it is capable of learning both simple and highly complex noise models, which we demonstrate on simulated and experimental data.},

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a public health problem with increasing prevalence as the population ages, associated with cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.Hypothesis: Evaluate the association between the presence of AF with overall and cardiovascular mortality in a large electronic cohort of primary care patients of Minas Gerais.Methods: This is an observational retrospective study. Patients over 16 years old who performed digital electrocardiograms by Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais from 2013 to 2016 were assessed. A probabilistic linkage between data from the national mortality information system and our ECG database was made. Clinical data were self-reported, and ECGs were interpreted by a team of trained cardiologists and automatic software (Glasgow and Minnesota).The diagnosis of AF was considered if there was concordance between the cardiologist's report and one of the automatic systems. In cases of disagreement, ECGs were reviewed manually.Only the first ECG made was analysed. To assess the relation between AF and mortality, Cox regression was used, adjusted by age, sex and clinical conditions.Results: From a dataset of 1,773,689 patients, 1,075,531 were included. The mean age was 51.4 years, 40.5\% male.The prevalence of AF was 1.15\%. There were 2.9\% deaths for all causes in 2.69 years of mean follow up. In univariate analysis, AF was a risk factor for death from all causes (HR 6.98, 95\%CI 6.68-7.28). After adjustment for age, sex and comorbidities, AF remained an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality (HR 2.49; 95\% CI 2.39 - 2.61). AF was also a predictor of risk for cardiovascular mortality after adjustment for age, sex and clinical conditions (HR 2.35, 95\% CI 2.01-2.73). In multivariate analysis by sex, adjusted for age and comorbidities, AF women had higher risk of death for all causes (HR 3.06; 95\% CI 2.86-3.26) than men (HR 2.18; 95\% CI 2.06-2.32). There were no difference between sex in cardiovascular mortality (HR 2.34; 95\% CI 2.01-2.73 for male sex e HR 2.49; 95\% CI 2.14-2.90 for female).Conclusions: AF was a strong predictor of mortality for all causes and cardiovascular mortality in primary care population with increased risk in women for deaths for all cause.},

	abstract = {We present a model for predicting electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities in short-duration 12-lead ECG signals which outperformed medical doctors on the 4th year of their cardiology residency. Such exams can provide a full evaluation of heart activity and have not been studied in previous end-to-end machine learning papers. Using the database of a large telehealth network, we built a novel dataset with more than 2 million ECG tracings, orders of magnitude larger than those used in previous studies. Moreover, our dataset is more realistic, as it consist of 12-lead ECGs recorded during standard in-clinics exams. Using this data, we trained a residual neural network with 9 convolutional layers to map 7 to 10 second ECG signals to 6 classes of ECG abnormalities. Future work should extend these results to cover a large range of ECG abnormalities, which could improve the accessibility of this diagnostic tool and avoid wrong diagnosis from medical doctors.},
