    Na minha apresentação, irei apresentar ferramentas analíticas para o treinamento robusto de modelos. Mostrarei como essa análise oferece insights sobre o fenômeno de "double-descent". Em seguida, discutirei avanços recentes que revelam o potencial dessas ferramentas no treinamento e estimativa de modelos com um grande número de parâmetros. Explorarei também as aplicações potenciais na medicina, detalhando planos para integrar essa abordagem ao meu trabalho em andamento sobre marcadores de risco de pacientes derivados de aprendizado de máquina a partir de Eletrocardiogramas, que agora estão avançando para ensaios clínicos.

    Cardiovascular diseases account for one-third of deaths worldwide and the electrocardiogram (ECG)
    is the major diagnostic tool for these diseases. This talk will discuss data-driven methods that leverage
    large medical cohorts to learn how to do diagnosis and prognosis from this exam. The talk is divided into
    two parts. In the first part, I discuss how incorporating new ideas from machine learning into system
    identification and signal processing allowed new applications in the automatic analysis of the ECG.
    Allowing it to be used to screen for diseases that would go undetected, to improve medical pipelines 
    and to find new risk markers. In the second part, I discuss my recent studies of when and how large
    models can be robust, the new challenges that arise when applying these large models in clinical practice,
    and how my future research intends to address these.

    Adversarial training can be used to develop models that are robust against perturbations. 
    In my talk, I present analytical tools for examining these models in linear settings. First,
    I demonstrate how these models provide valuable insights into robust double-descent phenomena. 
    Next, I discuss recent advancements that reveal these models' potential to extend beyond theoretical 
    applications and compete with traditional methods for high-dimensional linear-in-the-parameter estimation.
    Finally, I explore potential applications in precision medicine, detailing plans to integrate this approach 
    with my ongoing work on machine learning-derived patient risk markers from medical exams, which are now 
    advancing to clinical trials.

    State-of-the-art machine learning models can be vulnerable to very small input perturbations that are
    adversarially constructed. Adversarial training is an effective approach to defend against it. Formulated
    as a min-max problem, it searches for the best solution when the training data were corrupted by the
    worst-case attacks. Linear models are among the simple models where vulnerabilities can be observed
    and are the focus of our study. In this case, adversarial training leads to a convex optimization problem
    which can be formulated as the minimization of a finite sum. We provide a comparative analysis between the
    solution of adversarial training in linear regression and other regularization methods. Our main findings
    are that: (A) Adversarial training yields the minimum-norm interpolating solution in the overparameterized
    regime (more parameters than data), as long as the maximum disturbance radius is smaller than a threshold.
    And, conversely, the minimum-norm interpolator is the solution to adversarial training with a given radius.
    (B) Adversarial training can be equivalent to parameter shrinking methods (ridge regression and Lasso). This
    happens in the underparametrized region, for an appropriate choice of adversarial radius and zero-mean
    symmetrically distributed covariates. (C) For $\ell_\infty$-adversarial training---as in square-root
    Lasso---the choice of adversarial radius for optimal bounds does not depend on the additive noise variance.
    We confirm our theoretical findings with numerical examples.

    throughout the talk with examples of machine learning in cardiology, specifically applications where we use deep
    neural network models for the automatic diagnosis of the electrocardiogram.

    Modelos de aprendizado de máquina podem ser vulneráveis a perturbações de entrada muito pequenas construídas de
    forma adversárial. Examplos adversariais receberam muita atenção devido ao seu alto impacto no desempenho de
    modelos que, normalmente, produziriam resultados estado-da-arte. O treinamento adversárial é uma das abordagens
    mais eficazes para a defesa contra tais exemplos adversários e considera amostras perturbadas pelo adversário
    durante o treinamento para produzir modelos mais robustos. Nessa apresentação faremos uma análise comparativa
    entre a solução de treinamento adversárial em regressão linear e outros métodos de regularização. Há uma forte
    razão para esse foco: modelos de regressão linear permitem uma análise detalhada do problema. Além disso,
    muitos fenômenos interessantes observados em modelos não lineares ainda estão presentes e podem ser melhor
    entendidos. Por exemplo, a configuração pode usada para estudar como a alta dimensionalidade pode ser uma
    fonte adicional de robustez ou fragilidade para modelos. O método também possui propriedades favoráveis que
    permitem seu uso como um método básico para a estimar de modelos lineares.

    As áreas de identificação de sistemas e o aprendizado de máquina visam construir modelos matemáticos a partir de
    dados. Tradicionalmente, a escolha da família de modelos a ser considerada exige do designer um equilíbrio entre
    dois objetivos de natureza conflitante; esta deve ser ser flexível o suficiente para capturar a dinâmica do sistema,
    mas não tão flexível que aprenda efeitos espúrios a partir conjunto de dados. No entanto, a boa performance de
    famílias de modelos com grande flexibilidade, como redes neurais profundas, levaram a uma revisão desse paradigma.
    Nessa apresentação discutiremos os fenômenos de "double-descent" e de "benign-overfitting" que ajudam a interpretar
    essas idéias. Com especial foco em dois casos de interesse: sistemas dinâmicos e ataques adversáriais (para os quais
    a entrada do sistema é contaminada com perturbações selecionadas de forma a fazer o sistema fazer predições errôneas).

    State-of-the-art machine learning models can be vulnerable to very small input perturbations that are adversarially
    constructed. Adversarial attacks are a popular framework for studying these vulnerabilities. They consider worst-case
    input disturbances designed to maximize model error and got a lot of attention due to their impact on the performance
    of state-of-the-art models. Adversarial training considers extending model training with these examples and is an
    effective approach to defend against such attacks. This talk will explore adversarial attacks and training in linear
    regression. There is a strong reason for this focus, for linear regression, adversarial training can be formulated
    as a convex and quadratic problem. Moreover, many interesting phenomena that can be observed in nonlinear models are
    still present. The setup is used to study the relationship between high dimensionality and robustness. And to reveal
    the connection between adversarial training, parameter-shrinking methods, and minimum-norm solutions.
