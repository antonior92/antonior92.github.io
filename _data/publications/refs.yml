    abstract: Recent developments within deep learning are relevant for nonlinear
      system identification problems. In this paper, we establish connections between
      the deep learning and the system identification communities. It has recently
      been shown that convolutional architectures are at least as capable as recurrent
      architectures when it comes to sequence modeling tasks. Inspired by these results
      we explore the explicit relationships between the recently proposed temporal
      convolutional network (TCN) and two classic system identification model structures;
      Volterra series and block-oriented models. We end the paper with an experimental
      study where we provide results on two real-world problems, the well-known Silverbox
      dataset and a newer dataset originating from ground vibration experiments on
      an F-16 fighter aircraft.

    title: Atrial Fibrillation Risk Prediction from the 12-Lead ECG Using Digital
      Biomarkers and Deep Representation Learning
    year: '2021'

    abstract: This study aims to assess whether information derived from the raw 12-lead
      electrocardiogram (ECG) combined with clinical information is predictive of
      atrial fibrillation (AF) development.We use a subset of the Telehealth Network
      of Minas Gerais (TNMG) database consisting of patients that had repeated 12-lead
      ECG measurements between 2010-2017 that is 1,130,404 recordings from 415,389
      unique patients. Median and interquartile of age for the recordings were 58
      (46-69) and 38% of the patients were males. Recordings were assigned to train-validation
      and test sets in an 80:20% split which was stratified by class, age and gender.
      A random forest classifier was trained to predict, for a given recording, the
      risk of AF development within 5-years. We use features obtained from different
      modalities, namely demographics, clinical information, engineered features,
      and features from deep representation learning.The best model performance on
      the test set was obtained for the model combining features from all modalities
      with an AUROC=0.909 against the best single modality model which had an AUROC=0.839.Our
      study has important clinical implications for AF management. It is the first
      study integrating feature engineering, deep learning and EMR metadata to create
      a risk prediction tool for the management of patients at risk of AF. The best
      model that includes features from all modalities demonstrates that human knowledge
      in electrophysiology combined with deep learning outperforms any single modality
      approach. The high performance obtained suggest that structural changes in the
      12-lead ECG are associated with existing or impending AF.

    title: First Steps Towards Self-Supervised Pretraining of the 12-Lead ECG
    year: '2021'
    month: September
    journal: CinC
    volume: '48'
    pages: 1–4
    issn: 2325-887X
    doi: 10.23919/CinC53138.2021.9662748
    abstract: Self-supervised learning is a paradigm that extracts general features
      which describe the input space by artificially generating labels from the input
      without the need for explicit annotations. The learned features can then be
      used by transfer learning to boost the performance on a downstream task. Such
      methods have recently produced state of the art results in natural language
      processing and computer vision. Here, we propose a self-supervised learning
      method for 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). For pretraining the model we design
      a task to mask out subsegements of all channels of the input signals and try
      to predict the actual values. As the model architecture, we use a U-ResNet containing
      an encoder-decoder structure. We test our method by self-supervised pretraining
      on the CODE dataset and then transfer the learnt features by finetuning on the
      PTB-XL and CPSC benchmarks to evaluate the effect of our method in the classification
      of 12-leads ECGs. The method does provide modest improvements in performance
      when compared to not using pretraining. In future work we will make use of these
      ideas in smaller dataset, where we believe it can lead to larger performance
      gains.

    year: '2023'

    doi: 10.1109/LSP.2023.3275499
    abstract: Kernel principal component analysis (kPCA) is a widely studied method
      to construct a low-dimensional data representation after a nonlinear transformation.
      The prevailing method to reconstruct the original input signal from kPCA—an
      important task for denoising—requires us to solve a supervised learning problem.
      In this paper, we present an alternative method where the reconstruction follows
      naturally from the compression step. We first approximate the kernel with random
      Fourier features. Then, we exploit the fact that the nonlinear transformation
      is invertible in a certain subdomain. Hence, the name invertible kernel PCA
      (ikPCA) . We experiment with different data modalities and show that ikPCA performs
      similarly to kPCA with supervised reconstruction on denoising tasks, making
      it a strong alternative.

    abstract: 'Myocardial infarction diagnosis is a common challenge in the emergency
      department. In managed settings, deep learning-based models and especially convolutional
      deep models have shown promise in electrocardiogram (ECG) classification, but
      there is a lack of high-performing models for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction
      in real-world scenarios. We aimed to train and validate a deep learning model
      using ECGs to predict myocardial infarction in real-world emergency department
      patients. We studied emergency department patients in the Stockholm region between
      2007 and 2016 that had an ECG obtained because of their presenting complaint.
      We developed a deep neural network based on convolutional layers similar to
      a residual network. Inputs to the model were ECG tracing, age, and sex; and
      outputs were the probabilities of three mutually exclusive classes: non-ST-elevation
      myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI),
      and control status, as registered in the SWEDEHEART and other registries. We
      used an ensemble of five models. Among 492,226 ECGs in 214,250 patients, 5,416
      were recorded with an NSTEMI, 1,818 a STEMI, and 485,207 without a myocardial
      infarction. In a random test set, our model could discriminate STEMIs/NSTEMIs
      from controls with a C-statistic of 0.991/0.832 and had a Brier score of 0.001/0.008.
      The model obtained a similar performance in a temporally separated test set
      of the study sample, and achieved a C-statistic of 0.985 and a Brier score of
      0.002 in discriminating STEMIs from controls in an external test set. We developed
      and validated a deep learning model with excellent performance in discriminating
      between control, STEMI, and NSTEMI on the presenting ECG of a real-world sample
      of the important population of all-comers to the emergency department. Hence,
      deep learning models for ECG decision support could be valuable in the emergency
      department.'

    abstract: Aging affects the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and correlates with
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). AI-ECG models estimate aging effects as a novel
      biomarker but have only been evaluated on single ECGs—without utilizing longitudinal
      data. We validated an AI-ECG model, originally trained on Brazilian data, using
      a German cohort with over 20 years of follow-up, demonstrating similar performance
      (r2 = 0.70) to the original study (0.71). Incorporating longitudinal ECGs revealed
      a stronger association with cardiovascular risk, increasing the hazard ratio
      for mortality from 1.43 to 1.65. Moreover, aging effects were associated with
      higher odds ratios for atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and mortality. Using
      explainable AI methods revealed that the model aligns with clinical knowledge
      by focusing on ECG features known to reflect aging. Our study suggests that
      aging effects in longitudinal ECGs can be applied on population level as a novel
      biomarker to identify patients at risk early.

    abstract: 'Aim: Deep learning''s widespread use prompts heightened scrutiny, particularly
      in the biomedical fields, with a specific focus on model generalizability. This
      study delves into the influence of training data characteristics on the generalization
      performance of models, specifically in cardiac abnormality detection. Materials
      & methods: Leveraging diverse electrocardiogram datasets, models are trained
      on subsets with varying characteristics and subsequently compared for performance.
      Additionally, the introduction of the attention mechanism aims to improve generalizability.
      Results: Experiments reveal that using a balanced dataset, just 1% of a large
      dataset, leads to equal performance in generalization tasks, notably in detecting
      cardiology abnormalities. Conclusion: This balanced training data notably enhances
      model generalizability, while the integration of the attention mechanism further
      refines the model''s ability to generalize effectively. This study tackles a
      common problem for deep learning models: they often struggle when faced with
      new, unfamiliar data that they have not been trained on. This phenomenon is
      also known as performance drop in out-of-distribution generalization. This reduced
      performance on out-of-distribution generalization is a key focus of the research,
      aiming to improve the models'' ability to handle diverse data sets beyond their
      training data. The study examines how the characteristics of the dataset used
      to train deep learning models affect their ability to detect abnormal heart
      activities when applied to new, unseen data. Researchers trained these models
      using various sets of electrocardiogram (ECG) data and then evaluated their
      performance in identifying abnormalities. They also introduced an attention
      mechanism to enhance the models'' learning capabilities. The attention mechanism
      in deep learning is like a spotlight that helps the model focus on important
      information while ignoring less relevant details. The findings were particularly
      noteworthy. Despite being trained on a small, well-balanced subset of a larger
      dataset, the models excelled in detecting heart abnormalities in new, unfamiliar
      data. This training method significantly improved the models'' generalization
      and performance with unseen data. Furthermore, integrating the attention mechanism
      substantially enhanced the models'' ability to generalize effectively on new
      information. Investigate the impact of training data characteristics and attention
      mechanism on deep learning model generalizability in cardiac abnormality detection.
      Balanced dataset (1% of the total) improves model performance in generalization
      tasks, especially in detecting cardiology abnormalities. The attention mechanism
      further enhances the model''s capacity to comprehend and utilize out-of-distribution
      data effectively. Utilized multiple electrocardiogram datasets for the study.
      Trained models on subsets with varying characteristics and evaluated performance.
      Added attention mechanism to enhance learning capabilities. Balanced training
      data significantly enhances model generalizability. Attention mechanism improves
      the model''s ability to generalize on out-of-distribution data. Lack of clinical
      user information in datasets due to privacy and ethical considerations. Future
      research may consider patient-specific models for improved generalization in
      biomedical machine learning. Balanced and curated datasets are crucial for training
      high-performing models in cardiac abnormality detection using deep learning.
      Attention mechanisms show promise in enhancing model accuracy and generalization.'

    title: Deep Neural Network Estimated Electrocardiographic-Age as a Mortality Predictor
    year: '2021'
    journal: Nature Communications
    volume: '12'
    doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-25351-7
    abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most commonly used exam for the screening
      and evaluation of cardiovascular diseases. Here we propose that the age predicted
      by artificial intelligence (AI) from the raw ECG tracing (ECG-age) can be a
      measure of cardiovascular health and provide prognostic information. A deep
      convolutional neural network was trained to predict a patient9s age from the
      12-lead ECG using data from patients that underwent an ECG from 2010 to 2017
      - the CODE study cohort (n=1,558,415 patients). On the 15% hold-out CODE test
      split, patients with ECG-age more than 8 years greater than chronological age
      had a higher mortality rate (hazard ratio (HR) 1.79, p&lt;0.001) in a mean follow-up
      of 3.67 years, whereas those with ECG-age more than 8 years less than chronological
      age had a lower mortality rate (HR 0.78, p&lt;0.001). Similar results were obtained
      in the external cohorts ELSA-Brasil (n=14,236) and SaMi-Trop (n=1,631). The
      ability to predict mortality from the ECG predicted age remains even when we
      adjust the model for cardiovascular risk factors. Moreover, even for apparent
      normal ECGs, having a predicted ECG-age 8 or more years greater than chronological
      age remained a statistically significant predictor of risk (HR 1.53, p&lt;0.001
      in CODE 15% test split). These results show that AI-enabled analysis of the
      ECG can add prognostic information to the interpretation of the 12-lead ECGs.

    abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely considered the primary test for evaluating
      cardiovascular diseases. However, the use of artificial intelligence to advance
      these medical practices and learn new clinical insights from ECGs remains largely
      unexplored. Utilising a dataset of 2,322,513 ECGs collected from 1,558,772 patients
      with 7 years of follow-up, we developed a deep learning model with state-of-the-art
      granularity for the interpretable diagnosis of cardiac abnormalities, gender
      identification, and hyper- tension screening solely from ECGs, which are then
      used to stratify the risk of mortality. The model achieved the area under the
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.998 (95% confidence
      interval (CI), 0.995-0.999), 0.964 (0.963-0.965), and 0.839 (0.837-0.841) for
      the three diagnostic tasks separately. Using ECG-predicted results, we find
      high risks of mortality for subjects with sinus tachycardia (adjusted hazard
      ratio (HR) of 2.24, 1.96-2.57), and atrial fibrillation (adjusted HR of 2.22,
      1.99-2.48). We further use salient morphologies produced by the deep learning
      model to identify key ECG leads that achieved similar performance for the three
      diagnoses, and we find that the V1 ECG lead is important for hypertension screening
      and mortality risk stratification of hypertensive cohorts, with an AUC of 0.816
      (0.814-0.818) and a univariate HR of 1.70 (1.61-1.79) for the two tasks separately.
      Using ECGs alone, our developed model showed cardiologist-level accuracy in
      interpretable cardiac diagnosis, and the advancement in mortality risk stratification;
      In addition, the potential to facilitate clinical knowledge discovery for gender
      and hypertension detection which are not readily available.

    abstract: 'Despite the potentials of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare,
      very little work focuses on the extraction of clinical information or knowledge
      discovery from clinical measurements. Here we propose a novel deep learning
      model to extract characteristics in electrocardiogram (ECG) and explore its
      usage in knowledge discovery. Utilising a 12-lead ECG dataset (nECGs = 2,322,513)
      collected from unique subjects (nSubjects = 1,558,772) in primary care, we performed
      three independent medical tasks with the proposed model: (i) cardiac abnormality
      diagnosis, (ii) gender identification, and (iii) hypertension screening. We
      achieved an area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.998 (95% confidence interval
      (CI), 0.995-0.999), 0.964 (95% CI, 0.963-0.965), and 0.839 (95% CI, 0.837-0.841)
      for each task, respectively; We provide interpretation of salient morphologies
      and further identified key ECG leads that achieve similar performance for the
      three tasks: (i) AVR and V1 leads (AUC=0.990 (95% CI, 0.982-0.995); (ii) V5
      lead (AUC=0.900 (95% CI, 0.899-0.902)); and (iii) V1 lead (AUC=0.816 (95% CI,
      0.814-0.818)). Using ECGs, our model not only has demonstrated cardiologist-level

    doi: 10.1038/s44161-024-00564-3
    abstract: Cardiac trabeculae form a network of muscular strands that line the
      inner surfaces of the heart. Their development depends on multiscale morphogenetic
      processes and, while highly conserved across vertebrate evolution, their role
      in the pathophysiology of the mature heart is not fully understood. Here we
      report variant associations across the allele frequency spectrum for trabecular
      morphology in 47,803 participants of the UK Biobank using fractal dimension
      analysis of cardiac imaging. We identified an association between trabeculation
      and rare variants in 56 genes that regulate myocardial contractility and ventricular
      development. Genome-wide association studies identified 68 loci in pathways
      that regulate sarcomeric function, differentiation of the conduction system
      and cell fate determination. We found that trabeculation-associated variants
      were modifiers of cardiomyopathy phenotypes with opposing effects in hypertrophic
      and dilated cardiomyopathy. Together, these data provide insights into mechanisms
      that regulate trabecular development and plasticity, and identify a potential
      role in modifying monogenic disease expression.

    doi: 10.22489/CinC.2020.452
    abstract: 'In this work, we present a method to explain “end-toend” electrocardiogram
      (ECG) signal classifiers, where the explanations were built along with seniors
      cardiologist to provide meaningful features to the final users. Our method focuses
      exclusively on automated ECG diagnosis and analyzes the explanation in terms
      of clinical accuracy for interpretability and robustness. The proposed method
      uses a noise-insertion strategy to quantify the impact of intervals and segments
      of the ECG signals on the automated classification outcome. An ECG segmentation
      method was applied to ECG tracings, to obtain: (1) Intervals, Segments and Axis;
      (2) Rate, and (3) Rhythm. Noise was added to the signal to disturb the ECG features
      in a realistic way. The method was tested using Monte Carlo simulation and the
      feature impact is estimated by the change in the model prediction averaged over
      499 executions and a feature is defined as important if its mean value changes
      the result of the classifier. We demonstrate our method by explaining diagnoses
      generated by a deep convolutional neural network. The proposed method is particularly
      effective and useful for modern deep learning models that take raw data as input.'

    abstract: 'Introduction: Telehealth system is an important tool to improve access
      and quality to health assistance.Large electrocardiogram (ECG) databases, linked
      to mortality or hospitalization data, can be useful in determining the prognostic
      value of ECG markers. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a public health problem with
      increasing prevalence as the population ages, associated with cardiovascular
      mortality and morbidity.Hypothesis: Evaluate the association between the presence
      of AF with overall and cardiovascular mortality in a large electronic cohort
      of primary care patients of Minas Gerais.Methods: This is an observational retrospective
      study. Patients over 16 years old who performed digital electrocardiograms by
      Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais from 2013 to 2016 were assessed. A probabilistic
      linkage between data from the national mortality information system and our
      ECG database was made. Clinical data were self-reported, and ECGs were interpreted
      by a team of trained cardiologists and automatic software (Glasgow and Minnesota).The
      diagnosis of AF was considered if there was concordance between the cardiologist$\prime
      $s report and one of the automatic systems. In cases of disagreement, ECGs were
      reviewed manually.Only the first ECG made was analysed. To assess the relation
      between AF and mortality, Cox regression was used, adjusted by age, sex and
      clinical conditions.Results: From a dataset of 1,773,689 patients, 1,075,531
      were included. The mean age was 51.4 years, 40.5% male.The prevalence of AF
      was 1.15%. There were 2.9% deaths for all causes in 2.69 years of mean follow
      up. In univariate analysis, AF was a risk factor for death from all causes (HR
      6.98, 95%CI 6.68-7.28). After adjustment for age, sex and comorbidities, AF
      remained an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality (HR 2.49; 95% CI
      2.39 - 2.61). AF was also a predictor of risk for cardiovascular mortality after
      adjustment for age, sex and clinical conditions (HR 2.35, 95% CI 2.01-2.73).
      In multivariate analysis by sex, adjusted for age and comorbidities, AF women
      had higher risk of death for all causes (HR 3.06; 95% CI 2.86-3.26) than men
      (HR 2.18; 95% CI 2.06-2.32). There were no difference between sex in cardiovascular
      mortality (HR 2.34; 95% CI 2.01-2.73 for male sex e HR 2.49; 95% CI 2.14-2.90
      for female).Conclusions: AF was a strong predictor of mortality for all causes
      and cardiovascular mortality in primary care population with increased risk
      in women for deaths for all cause.'

    abstract: 'Computerized electrocardiography (ECG) has been widely used and allows
      linkage to electronic medical records. The present study describes the development
      and clinical applications of an electronic cohort derived from a digital ECG
      database obtained by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais, Brazil, for the
      period 2010–2017, linked to the mortality data from the national information
      system, the Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiography (CODE) dataset.
      From 2,470,424 ECGs, 1,773,689 patients were identified. A total of 1,666,778
      (94%) underwent a valid ECG recording for the period 2010 to 2017, with 1,558,421
      patients over 16 years old; 40.2% were men, with a mean age of 51.7 [SD 17.6]
      years. During a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, the mortality rate was 3.3%. ECG
      abnormalities assessed were: atrial fibrillation (AF), right bundle branch block
      (RBBB), left bundle branch block (LBBB), atrioventricular block (AVB), and ventricular
      pre-excitation. Most ECG abnormalities (AF: Hazard ratio [HR] 2.10; 95% CI 2.03–2.17;
      RBBB: HR 1.32; 95%CI 1.27–1.36; LBBB: HR 1.69; 95% CI 1.62–1.76; first degree
      AVB: Relative survival [RS]: 0.76; 95% CI0.71–0.81; 2:1 AVB: RS 0.21 95% CI0.09–0.52;
      and RS 0.36; third degree AVB: 95% CI 0.26–0.49) were predictors of overall
      mortality, except for ventricular pre-excitation (HR 1.41; 95% CI 0.56–3.57)
      and Mobitz I AVB (RS 0.65; 95% CI 0.34–1.24). In conclusion, a large ECG database
      established by a telehealth network can be a useful tool for facilitating new
      advances in the fields of digital electrocardiography, clinical cardiology and
      cardiovascular epidemiology.'

      was obtained linking data from ECG exams and those from a national mortality
      information system, using standard probabilistic linkage methods. We considered
      only the first ECG of each patient. Patients under 16 years were excluded. Hazard
      ratios (HR) for mortality were adjusted for demographic and self-reported clinical
      factors and estimated with Cox regression. Results: From a dataset of 1,773,689
      patients, 1,558,421 were included, mean age 51.6 years; 40.2% male. There were
      3.34% deaths from all causes in 3.68 years of median follow up. The prevalence

      Females with AF had a higher risk of overall and cardiovascular mortality compared

    abstract: 'Introduction: Aging affects the electrocardiogram (ECG) with a higher
      incidence of abnormalities in older patients. ECG-age can be predicted by artificial
      intelligence (AI) and can be used as a measure of cardiovascular health.Hypothesis:
      ECG-age predicted by AI is a risk factor for overall mortality.Methods: The
      Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiography (CODE) study is a retrospective
      cohort with a mean follow-up of 3.67 years.The dataset consists of Brazilian
      patients, mainly from primary care centers. Two established cohorts, ELSA-Brasil,
      of Brazilian public servants, and SaMi-Trop, of Chagas disease patients, were
      used for external validation. 2,322,513 ECGs from 1,558,421 patients over 16
      years old that underwent an ECG from 2010 to 2017 were included. A deep convolutional
      neural network was trained in order to predict the age of the patient based
      solely on ECG 12-lead tracings. The ECG database was split into 85-15% training
      and test datasets, respectively. Death was ascertained using probabilistic linkage
      with Brazil$\prime $s mortality information data. The Cox regression model,
      adjusted by age and sex, was used for statistical analysis. The model was validated
      in two cohorts: ELSA-Brasil (n=14,263) and SaMi-Trop (n=1,631).Results: he mean
      predicted ECG-age was 52.0 years (±18.7) with a mean absolute error of 8.38
      (±7.0) years. Patients with ECG-age $>$8y older than chronological age had higher
      mortality rate (HR 1.79, 95%CI 1.69-1.90; p$<$0.001), whereas those ECG-age
      $>$8y younger than chronological age were associated with a lower mortality
      rate (HR 0.78, 95%CI 0.74-0.83; p$<$0.001). These results were similar in ELSA-Brasil
      and SaMi-Trop external validation cohorts (HR 1.75, 95%CI 1.35-2.27; p$<$0.001;HR
      2.42, 95%CI 1.53-3.83; p$<$0.001 for $>$8y difference, retrospectively; HR 0.74,
      95%CI 0.63-0.88; p$<$0.001;HR 0.89, 95%CI 0.52-1.54; p=0.68 for $<$8y difference,
      respectively).Conclusions: ECG-age, predicted by AI, can be useful as a tool
      for risk stratification of mortality.'

    urldate: '2024-12-01'
    abstract: Cross-validation is commonly used to estimate machine learning model
      performance on new samples. However, using it for both hyperparameter selection
      and error estimation can lead to overestimating model performance, especially
      with extensive hyperparameter searches that overly tailor models to validation
      data. We demonstrate that deep learning further amplifies this bias, with even
      minor model adjustments causing significant overestimation. Our extensive experiments
      on simulated and real data focus on the bias from early stopping during cross-validation.
      We find that overestimation intensifies with network depth and is especially
      severe in small datasets, which are common in physiological signal processing
      applications. Selecting the early stopping point during cross-validation can
      result in ROC-AUC estimates exceeding 90\% on random data, and this effect persists
      across various sample sizes, architectures, and network sizes.

    primaryclass: cs
    doi: 10.48550/arXiv.2502.03081
    abstract: Decoding visual images from brain activity has significant potential
      for advancing brain-computer interaction and enhancing the understanding of
      human perception. Recent approaches align the representation spaces of images
      and brain activity to enable visual decoding. In this paper, we introduce the
      use of human-aligned image encoders to map brain signals to images. We hypothesize
      that these models more effectively capture perceptual attributes associated
      with the rapid visual stimuli presentations commonly used in visual brain data
      recording experiments. Our empirical results support this hypothesis, demonstrating
      that this simple modification improves image retrieval accuracy by up to 21%
      compared to state-of-the-art methods. Comprehensive experiments confirm consistent
      performance improvements across diverse EEG architectures, image encoders, alignment
      methods, participants, and brain imaging modalities.

    abstract: 'Objective: Chagas disease is a parasitic infection that is endemic
      to South America, Central America, and, more recently, the U.S., primarily transmitted
      by insects. Chronic Chagas disease can cause cardiovascular diseases and digestive
      problems. Serological testing capacities for Chagas disease are limited, but
      Chagas cardiomyopathy often manifests in ECGs, providing an opportunity to prioritize
      patients for testing and treatment. Approach: The George B. Moody PhysioNet
      Challenge 2025 invites teams to develop algorithmic approaches for identifying
      Chagas disease from electrocardiograms (ECGs). Main results: This Challenge
      provides multiple innovations. First, we leveraged several datasets with labels
      from patient reports and serological testing, provided a large dataset with
      weak labels and smaller datasets with strong labels. Second, we augmented the
      data to support model robustness and generalizability to unseen data sources.
      Third, we applied an evaluation metric that captured the local serological testing
      capacity for Chagas disease to frame the machine learning problem as a triage
      task. Significance: Over 630 participants from 111 teams submitted over 1300
      entries during the Challenge, representing diverse approaches from academia
      and industry worldwide.'

      aging and risk of atrial fibrillation: a multi-national study'', by S. Cho et
      al., https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae790.Ageing is a complex, multifaceted
      process encompassing biological, physiological, and psychosocial changes occurring
      over time. At the cellular and molecular levels, ageing is characterized by
      accumulating damage in cells and tissues, leading to a progressive decline in
      the body''s ability to maintain homeostasis and repair itself. This biological
      deterioration is not uniform across individuals or even within different organs
      of the same individual. While some organs may exhibit accelerated ageing, others
      might remain relatively preserved, highlighting the heterogeneity of the ageing
      process across the human body.1 The concept of `biological age'' vs. `chronological
      age'' is pivotal in understanding ageing. Chronological age is a simple measure
      of the years a person has lived, whereas biological age reflects the functional
      status and health of an individual''s organs and systems. Individuals of the
      same chronological age may have vastly different biological ages due to genetic
      predisposition, lifestyle factors, and environmental exposures. This variation
      can significantly impact disease risk and mortality. Understanding and measuring
      organ-specific ageing can open up avenues for targeted interventions that could
      decelerate ageing in specific organs, thereby improving overall health and extending
      a healthy life span.2'

      Network
    year: '2018'
    journal: Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) Workshop at NeurIPS
    eprint: '1811.12194'
    abstract: We present a model for predicting electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities
      in short-duration 12-lead ECG signals which outperformed medical doctors on
      the 4th year of their cardiology residency. Such exams can provide a full evaluation
      of heart activity and have not been studied in previous end-to-end machine learning
      papers. Using the database of a large telehealth network, we built a novel dataset
      with more than 2 million ECG tracings, orders of magnitude larger than those
      used in previous studies. Moreover, our dataset is more realistic, as it consist
      of 12-lead ECGs recorded during standard in-clinics exams. Using this data,
      we trained a residual neural network with 9 convolutional layers to map 7 to
      10 second ECG signals to 6 classes of ECG abnormalities. Future work should
      extend these results to cover a large range of ECG abnormalities, which could
      improve the accessibility of this diagnostic tool and avoid wrong diagnosis
      from medical doctors.

    title: Automatic 12-Lead ECG Classification Using a Convolutional Network Ensemble
    year: '2020'
    journal: CinC
    doi: 10.22489/CinC.2020.130
    abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a major diagnostic test for cardiovascular
      diseases and enhanced automated analysis tools might lead to more reliable diagnosis
      and improved clinical practice. Deep neural networks are models composed of
      stacked transformations that learn tasks by examples. Inspired by the success
      of these models in computer vision, we propose an end-to-end approach for the
      task at hand. We trained deep convolutional neural network models in the heterogeneous
      dataset provided in the Physionet 2020 Challenge and used an ensemble of seven
      of these convolutional models for the classification of abnormalities present
      in the ECG records. Ensembles use the output of multiple models to generate
      a combined prediction and are known to improve performance and generalization
      when compared to the individual models. In our submission, we use an ensemble
      of neural networks with the architecture similar to the one described in Nat
      Commun 11, 1760 (2020) for 12-lead ECGs classification. On the partially hidden
      test dataset from the challenge, the best-scored entry for our team (the “Code
      Team”) had a performance of 0.657, which place us in the 7-th place team-wise
      in the challenge leaderboard.

    primaryclass: stat
    urldate: '2025-02-04'
    abstract: Adversarial training can be used to learn models that are robust against
      perturbations. For linear models, it can be formulated as a convex optimization
      problem. Compared to methods proposed in the context of deep learning, leveraging
      the optimization structure allows significantly faster convergence rates. Still,
      the use of generic convex solvers can be inefficient for large-scale problems.
      Here, we propose tailored optimization algorithms for the adversarial training
      of linear models, which render large-scale regression and classification problems
      more tractable. For regression problems, we propose a family of solvers based
      on iterative ridge regression and, for classification, a family of solvers based
      on projected gradient descent. The methods are based on extended variable reformulations
      of the original problem. We illustrate their efficiency in numerical examples.

    abstract: 'A stereo camera is a camera that simultaneously captures two or more
      images in order to estimate depth. A stereo camera prototype was implemented
      using two image sensors. Its project was based on v200, a commercial camera
      produced by Invent Vision (iVision), company for which this prototype was developed.
      The major steps needed to estimate depth using a stereo camera were followed.
      They are: calibration (estimation of camera geometry and parameters), retification
      (aligning images), correspondence (finding correspondent points on the two images
      and the distance between them) and reconstruction (estimation of features depth
      using triangulation). All algorithms needed were implemented using C++ and integrated
      to the prototype. The prototype is able to estimate depth in a range of 0.7
      to 20 meters, it has a resolution on the order of a few centimeters and can
      reach a frame rate of 5 frames per second. The industrial camera v200 has all
      its internal processing computed by a FPGA. It is suggested, as a future work,
      to use the FPGA to speed up the retification and correspondence algorithms.
      The aim of this work was to take a first step towards a stereo camera based
      on v200 to be a competitive commercial product, apt to be sold by iVision.'

    abstract: As machine learning models start to be used in critical applications,
      their vulnerabilities and brittleness become a pressing concern. Adversarial
      attacks are a popular framework for studying these vulnerabilities. In this
      work, we study the error of linear regression in the face of adversarial attacks.
      We provide bounds of the error in terms of the traditional risk and the parameter
      norm and show how these bounds can be leveraged and make it possible to use
      analysis from non-adversarial setups to study the adversarial risk. The usefulness
      of these results is illustrated by shedding light on whether or not overparameterized
      linear models can be adversarially robust. We show that adding features to linear
      models might be either a source of additional robustness or brittleness. We
      show that these differences appear due to scaling and how the \$\textbackslashell
      _1\$ and \$\textbackslashell _2\$ norms of random projections concentrate. We
      also show how the reformulation we propose allows for solving adversarial training
      as a convex optimization problem. This is then used as a tool to study how adversarial
      training and other regularization methods might affect the robustness of the
      estimated models.

    abstract: 'Neural network models for dynamic systems can be trained either in
      parallel or in series-parallel configurations. Influenced by early arguments,
      several papers justify the choice of series-parallel rather than parallel configuration
      claiming it has a lower computational cost, better stability properties during
      training and provides more accurate results. Other published results, on the
      other hand, defend parallel training as being more robust and capable of yielding
      more accurate long-term predictions. The main contribution of this paper is
      to present a study comparing both methods under the same unified framework with
      special attention to three aspects: (i) robustness of the estimation in the
      presence of noise; (ii) computational cost; and, (iii) convergence. A unifying
      mathematical framework and simulation studies show situations where each training
      method provides superior validation results and suggest that parallel training
      is generally better in more realistic scenarios. An example using measured data
      seems to reinforce such a claim. Complexity analysis and numerical examples
      show that both methods have similar computational cost although series-parallel
      training is more amenable to parallelization. Some informal discussion about
      stability and convergence properties is presented and explored in the examples.'

    abstract: This paper studies parameter estimation of output error (OE) models.
      The commonly used approach of minimizing the free-run simulation error is called
      single shooting in contrast with the new multiple shooting approach proposed
      in this paper, for which the free-run simulation error of sub-datasets is minimized
      subject to equality constraints. The names “single shooting” and “multiple shooting”
      are used due to the similarities with techniques for estimating ODE (ordinary
      differential equation) parameters. Examples with nonlinear polynomial models
      illustrate the advantages of OE models as well as the capability of the multiple
      shooting approach to avoid undesirable local minima.

    pages: '109158'
    doi: 10.1016/j.automatica.2020.109158
    abstract: We shed new light on the smoothness of optimization problems arising
      in prediction error parameter estimation of linear and nonlinear systems. We
      show that for regions of the parameter space where the model is not contractive,
      the Lipschitz constant and beta-smoothness of the objective function might blow
      up exponentially with the simulation length, making it hard to numerically find
      minima within those regions or, even, to escape from them. In addition to providing
      theoretical understanding of this problem, this paper also proposes the use
      of multiple shooting as a viable solution. The proposed method minimizes the
      error between a prediction model and the observed values. Rather than running
      the prediction model over the entire dataset, multiple shooting splits the data
      into smaller subsets and runs the prediction model over each subset, making
      the simulation length a design parameter and making it possible to solve problems
      that would be infeasible using a standard approach. The equivalence to the original
      problem is obtained by including constraints in the optimization. The new method
      is illustrated by estimating the parameters of nonlinear systems with chaotic
      or unstable behavior, as well as neural networks. We also present a comparative
      analysis of the proposed method with multi-step-ahead prediction error minimization.

    urldate: '2022-05-26'
    abstract: State-of-the-art machine learning models can be vulnerable to very small
      input perturbations that are adversarially constructed. Adversarial training
      is one of the most effective approaches to defend against such examples. We
      show that for linear regression problems, adversarial training can be formulated
      as a convex problem. This fact is then used to show that \$\textbackslashell
      _\textbackslashinfty \$-adversarial training produces sparse solutions and has
      many similarities to the lasso method. Similarly, \$\textbackslashell _2\$-adversarial
      training has similarities with ridge regression. We use a robust regression
      framework to analyze and understand these similarities and also point to some
      differences. Finally, we show how adversarial training behaves differently from
      other regularization methods when estimating overparameterized models (i.e.,
      models with more parameters than datapoints). It minimizes a sum of three terms
      which regularizes the solution, but unlike lasso and ridge regression, it can
      sharply transition into an interpolation mode. We show that for sufficiently
      many features or sufficiently small regularization parameters, the learned model
      perfectly interpolates the training data while still exhibiting good out-of-sample
      performance.

    abstract: Digital electrocardiographs are now widely available and a large number
      of digital electrocardiograms (ECGs) have been recorded and stored. The present
      study describes the development and clinical applications of a large database
      of such digital ECGs, namely the CODE (Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiology)
      study. ECGs obtained by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais, Brazil, from
      2010 to 17, were organized in a structured database. A hierarchical free-text
      machine learning algorithm recognized specific ECG diagnoses from cardiologist
      reports. The Glasgow ECG Analysis Program provided Minnesota Codes and automatic
      diagnostic statements. The presence of a specific ECG abnormality was considered
      when both automatic and medical diagnosis were concordant; cases of discordance
      were decided using heuristisc rules and manual review. The ECG database was
      linked to the national mortality information system using probabilistic linkage
      methods. From 2,470,424 ECGs, 1,773,689 patients were identified. After excluding
      the ECGs with technical problems and patients $<$16\,years-old, 1,558,415 patients
      were studied. High performance measures were obtained using an end-to-end deep
      neural network trained to detect 6 types of ECG abnormalities, with F1 scores
      $>$80% and specificity $>$99% in an independent test dataset. We also evaluated
      the risk of mortality associated with the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF),
      which showed that AF was a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality and
      mortality for all causes, with increased risk in women. In conclusion, a large
      database that comprises all ECGs performed by a large telehealth network can
      be useful for further developments in the field of digital electrocardiography,
      clinical cardiology and cardiovascular epidemiology.

    title: Detection of Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction from Electrocardiographic
      Images
    year: '2023'
    journal: Circulation
    doi: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.062646
    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction is associated
      with a $>$8-fold increased risk of heart failure and a 2-fold risk of premature
      death. The use of ECG signals in screening for LV systolic dysfunction is limited
      by their availability to clinicians. We developed a novel deep learning–based
      approach that can use ECG images for the screening of LV systolic dysfunction.
      METHODS: Using 12-lead ECGs plotted in multiple different formats, and corresponding
      echocardiographic data recorded within 15 days from the Yale New Haven Hospital
      between 2015 and 2021, we developed a convolutional neural network algorithm
      to detect an LV ejection fraction $<$40%. The model was validated within clinical
      settings at Yale New Haven Hospital and externally on ECG images from Cedars
      Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, CA; Lake Regional Hospital in Osage Beach,
      MO; Memorial Hermann Southeast Hospital in Houston, TX; and Methodist Cardiology
      Clinic of San Antonio, TX. In addition, it was validated in the prospective
      Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health. Gradient-weighted class activation
      mapping was used to localize class-discriminating signals in ECG images. RESULTS:
      Overall, 385\,601 ECGs with paired echocardiograms were used for model development.
      The model demonstrated high discrimination power across various ECG image formats
      and calibrations in internal validation (area under receiving operation characteristics
      [AUROCs], 0.91; area under precision-recall curve [AUPRC], 0.55); and external
      sets of ECG images from Cedars Sinai (AUROC, 0.90 and AUPRC, 0.53), outpatient
      Yale New Haven Hospital clinics (AUROC, 0.94 and AUPRC, 0.77), Lake Regional
      Hospital (AUROC, 0.90 and AUPRC, 0.88), Memorial Hermann Southeast Hospital
      (AUROC, 0.91 and AUPRC 0.88), Methodist Cardiology Clinic (AUROC, 0.90 and AUPRC,
      0.74), and Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health cohort (AUROC, 0.95
      and AUPRC, 0.45). An ECG suggestive of LV systolic dysfunction portended a $>$27-fold
      higher odds of LV systolic dysfunction on transthoracic echocardiogram (odds
      ratio, 27.5 [95% CI, 22.3–33.9] in the held-out set). Class-discriminative patterns
      localized to the anterior and anteroseptal leads (V2 to V3), corresponding to
      the left ventricle regardless of the ECG layout. A positive ECG screen in individuals
      with an LV ejection fraction ≥40% at the time of initial assessment was associated
      with a 3.9-fold increased risk of developing incident LV systolic dysfunction
      in the future (hazard ratio, 3.9 [95% CI, 3.3–4.7]; median follow-up, 3.2 years).
      CONCLUSIONS: We developed and externally validated a deep learning model that
      identifies LV systolic dysfunction from ECG images. This approach represents
      an automated and accessible screening strategy for LV systolic dysfunction,
      particularly in low-resource settings.'

    abstract: Background and Aims Artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiograms
      (AI-ECG) can be used to predict risk of future disease and mortality but has
      not yet been adopted into clinical practice. Existing model predictions lack
      actionability at an individual patient level, explainability and biological
      plausibility. We sought to address these limitations of previous AI-ECG approaches
      by developing the AI-ECG risk estimator (AIRE) platform. Methods and Results
      The AIRE platform was developed in a secondary care dataset of 1,163,401 ECGs
      from 189,539 patients, using deep learning with a discrete-time survival model
      to create a subject-specific survival curve using a single ECG. Therefore, AIRE
      predicts not only risk of mortality, but time-to-mortality. AIRE was validated
      in five diverse, transnational cohorts from the USA, Brazil and the UK, including
      volunteers, primary care and secondary care subjects. AIRE accurately predicts
      risk of all-cause mortality (C-index 0.775 (0.773-0.776)), cardiovascular (CV)
      death 0.832 (0.831-0.834), non-CV death (0.749 (0.747-0.751)), future ventricular
      arrhythmia (0.760 (0.756-0.763)), future atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
      (0.696 (0.694-0.698)) and future heart failure (0.787 (0.785-0.889))). Through
      phenome- and genome-wide association studies, we identified candidate biological
      pathways for the prediction of increased risk, including changes in cardiac
      structure and function, and genes associated with cardiac structure, biological
      aging and metabolic syndrome. Conclusion AIRE is an actionable, explainable
      and biologically plausible AI-ECG risk estimation platform that has the potential
      for use worldwide across a wide range of clinical contexts for short- and long-term
      risk estimation. $<$img class="highwire-fragment fragment-image" alt="Figure"

    abstract: Summary Background Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled electrocardiography
      (ECG) can be used to predict risk of future disease and mortality but has not
      yet been adopted into clinical practice. Existing model predictions do not have
      actionability at an individual patient level, explainability, or biological
      plausibi. We sought to address these limitations of previous AI-ECG approaches
      by developing the AI-ECG risk estimator (AIRE) platform. Methods The AIRE platform
      was developed in a secondary care dataset (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
      [BIDMC]) of 1\hphantom ,163\hphantom ,401 ECGs from 189\hphantom ,539 patients
      with deep learning and a discrete-time survival model to create a patient-specific
      survival curve with a single ECG. Therefore, AIRE predicts not only risk of
      mortality, but also time-to-mortality. AIRE was validated in five diverse, transnational
      cohorts from the USA, Brazil, and the UK (UK Biobank [UKB]), including volunteers,
      primary care patients, and secondary care patients. Findings AIRE accurately
      predicts risk of all-cause mortality (BIDMC C-index 0·775, 95% CI 0·773–0·776;
      C-indices on external validation datasets 0·638–0·773), future ventricular arrhythmia
      (BIDMC C-index 0·760, 95% CI 0·756–0·763; UKB C-index 0·719, 95% CI 0·635–0·803),
      future atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (0·696, 0·694–0·698; 0·643, 0·624–0·662),
      and future heart failure (0·787, 0·785–0·789; 0·768, 0·733–0·802). Through phenome-wide
      and genome-wide association studies, we identified candidate biological pathways
      for the prediction of increased risk, including changes in cardiac structure
      and function, and genes associated with cardiac structure, biological ageing,
      and metabolic syndrome. Interpretation AIRE is an actionable, explainable, and
      biologically plausible AI-ECG risk estimation platform that has the potential
      for use worldwide across a wide range of clinical contexts for short-term and
      long-term risk estimation. Funding British Heart Foundation, National Institute

    abstract: Background Females are typically underserved in cardiovascular medicine.
      The use of sex as a dichotomous variable for risk stratification fails to capture
      the heterogeneity of risk within each sex. We aimed to develop an artificial
      intelligence-enhanced electrocardiography (AI-ECG) model to investigate sex-specific
      cardiovascular risk. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we trained
      a convolutional neural network to classify sex using the 12-lead electrocardiogram
      (ECG). The Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) secondary care dataset,
      comprising data from individuals who had clinically indicated ECGs performed
      in a hospital setting in Boston, MA, USA collected between May, 2000, and March,
      2023, was the derivation cohort (1\hphantom ,163\hphantom ,401 ECGs). 50% of
      this dataset was used for model training, 10% for validation, and 40% for testing.
      External validation was performed using the UK Biobank cohort, comprising data
      from volunteers aged 40–69 years at the time of enrolment in 2006–10 (42\hphantom
      ,386 ECGs). We examined the difference between AI-ECG-predicted sex (continuous)
      and biological sex (dichotomous), termed sex discordance score. Findings AI-ECG
      accurately identified sex (area under the receiver operating characteristic
      0·943 [95% CI 0·942–0·943] for BIDMC and 0·971 [0·969–0·972] for the UK Biobank).
      In BIDMC outpatients with normal ECGs, an increased sex discordance score was
      associated with covariate-adjusted increased risk of cardiovascular death in
      females (hazard ratio [HR] 1·78 [95% CI 1·18–2·70], p=0·006) but not males (1·00
      [0·63–1·58], p=0·996). In the UK Biobank cohort, the same pattern was seen (HR
      1·33 [95% CI 1·06–1·68] for females, p=0·015; 0·98 [0·80–1·20] for males, p=0·854).
      Females with a higher sex discordance score were more likely to have future
      heart failure or myocardial infarction in the BIDMC cohort and had more male
      cardiac (increased left ventricular mass and chamber volumes) and non-cardiac
      phenotypes (increased muscle mass and reduced body fat percentage) in both cohorts.
      Interpretation Sex discordance score is a novel AI-ECG biomarker capable of
      identifying females with disproportionately elevated cardiovascular risk. AI-ECG
      has the potential to identify female patients who could benefit from enhanced
      risk factor modification or surveillance. Funding British Heart Foundation.

    abstract: Most artificial intelligence-enhanced ECG (AI-ECG) models used to predict
      adverse events including death require that the ECGs be stored digitally. However,
      the majority of clinical facilities worldwide store ECGs as images.1,163,401
      ECGs (189,539 patients) from a secondary care dataset were available as both
      natively digital traces and PDF images. A digitisation pipeline extracted signals
      from PDFs. Separate 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) models were trained
      on natively digital or digitised ECGs, with a discrete-time survival loss function
      to predict time-to-mortality. A 2D CNN model was trained on 310x868 pixel ECG
      images. External validation was performed in 958,954 ECGs (645,373 patients)
      from a Brazilian primary care cohort and 1022 ECGs (1022 patients) from a Chagas
      disease cohort.The image 2D CNN model and digitised 1D CNN model performed comparably
      to natively digital 1D CNN model in internal (C-index 0.780 (0.779-0.781), 0.772
      (0.771-0.774) and 0.775 (0.774-0.776 respectively) and external validation.
      Models trained on natively digital 1D ECGs had comparable performance when applied
      to digitised 1D ECGs (C-index 0.773 (0.771-0.774).Both the image 2D CNN and
      digitised 1D CNN enable mortality prediction from ECG images, with comparable
      performance to natively digital 1D CNN. Models trained on natively digital 1D
      ECGs can also be applied to digitised 1D ECGs, without any significant loss
      in performance. This works allows AI-ECG mortality prediction to be applied
      in diverse global settings lacking digital ECG infrastructure.

    abstract: 'Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the most widespread cause of death
      across the world, and this aspect requires a better risk stratification method.
      Effectively, this paper tests the potential of the artificial intelligence (AI)-predicted
      electrocardiogram (ECG) age as a novel CVD risk predictor biomarker. We used
      the CODE-15 % data (over 344,000 ECG records with clinical annotation) to create
      a logistic regression model that incorporated age predicted from ECG, as well
      as demographic and comorbidity variables, to evaluate cardiovascular outcomes.
      The model performed better with ECG-predicted age than using chronological age
      alone, with a 92 % receiver operating characteristic curve area (AUROC) for
      atrial fibrillation (AF) detection, compared to 88 % when chronological age
      was used alone. From the results, the ECG-predicted age showed a stronger correlation
      with AF (r = 0.17), bundle branch blocks (r = 0.14), and Chagas disease (r = 0.074)
      than chronological age. Sex-specific patterns were also observed; male sex had
      an increased risk of sinus bradycardia (odds ratio [OR]: 3.090), while female
      sex had a lower risk of having a left bundle branch block (LBBB) OR: 0.885)
      with the variable of ECG-predicted age. These results demonstrate how ECG-predicted
      age may be used as a biologically meaningful indicator for cardiovascular risk
      assessment. This study advances personalized medicine by offering a cost-effective
      and scalable method for detecting CVD, particularly in under-resourced regions
      that lack conventional biomarkers.'

    abstract: SciPy is an open source scientific computing library for the Python
      programming language. SciPy 1.0 was released in late 2017, about 16 years after
      the original version 0.1 release. SciPy has become a de facto standard for leveraging
      scientific algorithms in the Python programming language, with more than 600
      unique code contributors, thousands of dependent packages, over 100,000 dependent
      repositories, and millions of downloads per year. This includes usage of SciPy
      in almost half of all machine learning projects on GitHub, and usage by high
      profile projects including LIGO gravitational wave analysis and creation of
      the first-ever image of a black hole (M87). The library includes functionality
      spanning clustering, Fourier transforms, integration, interpolation, file I/O,
      linear algebra, image processing, orthogonal distance regression, minimization
      algorithms, signal processing, sparse matrix handling, computational geometry,
      and statistics. In this work, we provide an overview of the capabilities and
      development practices of the SciPy library and highlight some recent technical
      developments.

    title: Evaluating Regression and Probabilistic Methods for ECG-based Electrolyte
      Prediction
    year: '2024'
    journal: Scientific Reports
    volume: '14'
    number: '15273'

    abstract: Imbalances in electrolyte concentrations can have severe consequences,
      but accurate and accessible measurements could improve patient outcomes. The
      current measurement method based on blood tests is accurate but invasive and
      time-consuming and is often unavailable for example in remote locations or an
      ambulance setting. In this paper, we explore the use of deep neural networks
      (DNNs) for regression tasks to accurately predict continuous electrolyte concentrations
      from electrocardiograms (ECGs), a quick and widely adopted tool. We analyze
      our DNN models on a novel dataset of over 290,000 ECGs across four major electrolytes
      and compare their performance with traditional machine learning models. For
      improved understanding, we also study the full spectrum from continuous predictions
      to a binary classification of extreme concentration levels. Finally, we investigate
      probabilistic regression approaches and explore uncertainty estimates for enhanced
      clinical usefulness. Our results show that DNNs outperform traditional models
      but model performance varies significantly across different electrolytes. While
      discretization leads to good classification performance, it does not address
      the original problem of continuous concentration level prediction. Probabilistic
      regression has practical potential, but our uncertainty estimates are not perfectly
      calibrated. Our study is therefore a first step towards developing an accurate
      and reliable ECG-based method for electrolyte concentration level prediction—a
      method with high potential impact within multiple clinical scenarios.

    title: On Merging Feature Engineering and Deep Learning for Diagnosis, Risk-Prediction
      and Age Estimation Based on the 12-Lead ECG
    year: '2023'
    month: January
    journal: IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering
    eprint: '2207.06096'

    abstract: 'Objective: Over the past few years, deep learning (DL) has been used
      extensively in research for 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. However,
      it is unclear whether the explicit or implicit claims made on DL superiority
      to the more classical feature engineering (FE) approaches, based on domain knowledge,
      hold. In addition, it remains unclear whether combining DL with FE may improve
      performance over a single modality. Methods: To address these research gaps
      and in-line with recent major experiments, we revisited three tasks: cardiac
      arrhythmia diagnosis (multiclass-multilabel classification), atrial fibrillation
      risk prediction (binary classification), and age estimation (regression). We
      used an overall dataset of 2.3M 12-lead ECG recordings to train the following
      models for each task: i) a random forest taking FE as input; ii) an end-to-end
      DL model; and iii) a merged model of FE+DL. Results: FE yielded comparable results
      to DL while necessitating significantly less data for the two classification
      tasks. DL outperformed FE for the regression task. For all tasks, merging FE
      with DL did not improve performance over DL alone. These findings were confirmed
      on the additional PTB-XL dataset. Conclusion: We found that for traditional
      12-lead ECG based diagnosis tasks, DL did not yield a meaningful improvement
      over FE, while it improved significantly the nontraditional regression task.
      We also found that combining FE with DL did not improve over DL alone, which
      suggests that the FE were redundant with the features learned by DL. Significance:
      Our findings provides important recommendations on 12-lead ECG based machine
      learning strategy and data regime to choose for a given task. When looking at
      maximizing performance as the end goal, if the task is nontraditional and a
      large dataset is available then DL is preferable. If the task is a classical
      one and/or a small dataset is available then a FE approach may be the better
      choice.'
