        abstract: Recent developments within deep learning are relevant for nonlinear
            system identification problems. In this paper, we establish connections
            between the deep learning and the system identification communities. It
            has recently been shown that convolutional architectures are at least
            as capable as recurrent architectures when it comes to sequence modeling
            tasks. Inspired by these results we explore the explicit relationships
            between the recently proposed temporal convolutional network (TCN) and
            two classic system identification model structures; Volterra series and
            block-oriented models. We end the paper with an experimental study where
            we provide results on two real-world problems, the well-known Silverbox
            dataset and a newer dataset originating from ground vibration experiments
            on an F-16 fighter aircraft.

        abstract: This study aims to assess whether information derived from the raw
            12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) combined with clinical information is
            predictive of atrial fibrillation (AF) development.We use a subset of
            the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais (TNMG) database consisting of patients
            that had repeated 12-lead ECG measurements between 2010-2017 that is 1,130,404
            recordings from 415,389 unique patients. Median and interquartile of age
            for the recordings were 58 (46-69) and 38\% of the patients were males.
            Recordings were assigned to train-validation and test sets in an 80:20\%
            split which was stratified by class, age and gender. A random forest classifier
            was trained to predict, for a given recording, the risk of AF development
            within 5-years. We use features obtained from different modalities, namely
            demographics, clinical information, engineered features, and features
            from deep representation learning.The best model performance on the test
            set was obtained for the model combining features from all modalities
            with an AUROC=0.909 against the best single modality model which had an
            AUROC=0.839.Our study has important clinical implications for AF management.
            It is the first study integrating feature engineering, deep learning and
            EMR metadata to create a risk prediction tool for the management of patients
            at risk of AF. The best model that includes features from all modalities
            demonstrates that human knowledge in electrophysiology combined with deep
            learning outperforms any single modality approach. The high performance
            obtained suggest that structural changes in the 12-lead ECG are associated
            with existing or impending AF.

        abstract: Self-supervised learning is a paradigm that extracts general features
            which describe the input space by artificially generating labels from
            the input without the need for explicit annotations. The learned features
            can then be used by transfer learning to boost the performance on a downstream
            task. Such methods have recently produced state of the art results in
            natural language processing and computer vision. Here, we propose a self-supervised
            learning method for 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). For pretraining
            the model we design a task to mask out subsegements of all channels of
            the input signals and try to predict the actual values. As the model architecture,
            we use a U-ResNet containing an encoder-decoder structure. We test our
            method by self-supervised pretraining on the CODE dataset and then transfer
            the learnt features by finetuning on the PTB-XL and CPSC benchmarks to
            evaluate the effect of our method in the classification of 12-leads ECGs.
            The method does provide modest improvements in performance when compared
            to not using pretraining. In future work we will make use of these ideas
            in smaller dataset, where we believe it can lead to larger performance
            gains.

        abstract: Kernel principal component analysis (kPCA) is a widely studied method
            to construct a low-dimensional data representation after a nonlinear transformation.
            The prevailing method to reconstruct the original input signal from kPCA---an
            important task for denoising---requires us to solve a supervised learning
            problem. In this paper, we present an alternative method where the reconstruction
            follows naturally from the compression step. We first approximate the
            kernel with random Fourier features. Then, we exploit the fact that the
            nonlinear transformation is invertible in a certain subdomain. Hence,
            the name invertible kernel PCA (ikPCA) . We experiment with different
            data modalities and show that ikPCA performs similarly to kPCA with supervised
            reconstruction on denoising tasks, making it a strong alternative.

        abstract: 'Myocardial infarction diagnosis is a common challenge in the emergency
            department. In managed settings, deep learning-based models and especially
            convolutional deep models have shown promise in electrocardiogram (ECG)
            classification, but there is a lack of high-performing models for the
            diagnosis of myocardial infarction in real-world scenarios. We aimed to
            train and validate a deep learning model using ECGs to predict myocardial
            infarction in real-world emergency department patients. We studied emergency
            department patients in the Stockholm region between 2007 and 2016 that
            had an ECG obtained because of their presenting complaint. We developed
            a deep neural network based on convolutional layers similar to a residual
            network. Inputs to the model were ECG tracing, age, and sex; and outputs
            were the probabilities of three mutually exclusive classes: non-ST-elevation
            myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI),
            and control status, as registered in the SWEDEHEART and other registries.
            We used an ensemble of five models. Among 492,226 ECGs in 214,250 patients,
            5,416 were recorded with an NSTEMI, 1,818 a STEMI, and 485,207 without
            a myocardial infarction. In a random test set, our model could discriminate
            STEMIs/NSTEMIs from controls with a C-statistic of 0.991/0.832 and had
            a Brier score of 0.001/0.008. The model obtained a similar performance
            in a temporally separated test set of the study sample, and achieved a
            C-statistic of 0.985 and a Brier score of 0.002 in discriminating STEMIs
            from controls in an external test set. We developed and validated a deep
            learning model with excellent performance in discriminating between control,
            STEMI, and NSTEMI on the presenting ECG of a real-world sample of the
            important population of all-comers to the emergency department. Hence,
            deep learning models for ECG decision support could be valuable in the
            emergency department.'

        abstract: Aging affects the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and correlates
            with cardiovascular disease (CVD). AI-ECG models estimate aging effects
            as a novel biomarker but have only been evaluated on single ECGs---without
            utilizing longitudinal data. We validated an AI-ECG model, originally
            trained on Brazilian data, using a German cohort with over 20 years of
            follow-up, demonstrating similar performance (r2 = 0.70) to the original
            study (0.71). Incorporating longitudinal ECGs revealed a stronger association
            with cardiovascular risk, increasing the hazard ratio for mortality from
            1.43 to 1.65. Moreover, aging effects were associated with higher odds
            ratios for atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and mortality. Using explainable
            AI methods revealed that the model aligns with clinical knowledge by focusing
            on ECG features known to reflect aging. Our study suggests that aging
            effects in longitudinal ECGs can be applied on population level as a novel
            biomarker to identify patients at risk early.

        abstract: 'Aim: Deep learning''s widespread use prompts heightened scrutiny,
            particularly in the biomedical fields, with a specific focus on model
            generalizability. This study delves into the influence of training data
            characteristics on the generalization performance of models, specifically
            in cardiac abnormality detection. Materials \& methods: Leveraging diverse
            electrocardiogram datasets, models are trained on subsets with varying
            characteristics and subsequently compared for performance. Additionally,
            the introduction of the attention mechanism aims to improve generalizability.
            Results: Experiments reveal that using a balanced dataset, just 1\% of
            a large dataset, leads to equal performance in generalization tasks, notably
            in detecting cardiology abnormalities. Conclusion: This balanced training
            data notably enhances model generalizability, while the integration of
            the attention mechanism further refines the model''s ability to generalize
            effectively. This study tackles a common problem for deep learning models:
            they often struggle when faced with new, unfamiliar data that they have
            not~been trained on. This phenomenon is also known as performance drop
            in out-of-distribution generalization. This reduced performance on out-of-distribution
            generalization is a key focus of the research, aiming to improve the models''~ability
            to handle diverse data sets beyond their training data. The study examines
            how the characteristics of the dataset used to train deep learning models
            affect their ability to detect abnormal heart activities when applied
            to new, unseen data. Researchers trained these models using various sets
            of electrocardiogram~(ECG)~data and then evaluated their performance in
            identifying abnormalities. They also introduced an attention mechanism
            to enhance the models''~learning capabilities. The attention mechanism
            in deep learning is like a spotlight that helps the model focus on important
            information while ignoring less relevant details. The findings were particularly
            noteworthy. Despite being trained on a small, well-balanced subset of
            a larger dataset, the models excelled in detecting heart abnormalities
            in new, unfamiliar data. This training method significantly improved the
            models''~generalization and performance with unseen data. Furthermore,
            integrating the attention mechanism substantially enhanced the models''~ability
            to generalize effectively on new information. Investigate the impact of
            training data characteristics and attention mechanism on deep learning
            model generalizability in cardiac abnormality detection. Balanced dataset
            (1\% of the total) improves model performance in generalization tasks,
            especially in detecting cardiology abnormalities. The attention mechanism
            further enhances the model''s capacity to comprehend and utilize out-of-distribution
            data effectively. Utilized multiple electrocardiogram datasets for the
            study. Trained models on subsets with varying characteristics and evaluated
            performance. Added attention mechanism to enhance learning capabilities.
            Balanced training data significantly enhances model generalizability.
            Attention mechanism improves the model''s ability to generalize on out-of-distribution
            data. Lack of clinical user information in datasets due to privacy and
            ethical considerations. Future research may consider patient-specific
            models for improved generalization in biomedical machine learning. Balanced
            and curated datasets are crucial for training high-performing models in
            cardiac abnormality detection using deep learning. Attention mechanisms
            show promise in enhancing model accuracy and generalization.'

            Predictor
        year: '2021'
        journal: Nature Communications
        volume: '12'
        doi: 10.1038/s41467-021-25351-7
        abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most commonly used exam for the
            screening and evaluation of cardiovascular diseases. Here we propose that
            the age predicted by artificial intelligence (AI) from the raw ECG tracing
            (ECG-age) can be a measure of cardiovascular health and provide prognostic
            information. A deep convolutional neural network was trained to predict
            a patient9s age from the 12-lead ECG using data from patients that underwent
            an ECG from 2010 to 2017 - the CODE study cohort (n=1,558,415 patients).
            On the 15\% hold-out CODE test split, patients with ECG-age more than
            8 years greater than chronological age had a higher mortality rate (hazard
            ratio (HR) 1.79, p\&lt;0.001) in a mean follow-up of 3.67 years, whereas
            those with ECG-age more than 8 years less than chronological age had a
            lower mortality rate (HR 0.78, p\&lt;0.001). Similar results were obtained
            in the external cohorts ELSA-Brasil (n=14,236) and SaMi-Trop (n=1,631).
            The ability to predict mortality from the ECG predicted age remains even
            when we adjust the model for cardiovascular risk factors. Moreover, even
            for apparent normal ECGs, having a predicted ECG-age 8 or more years greater
            than chronological age remained a statistically significant predictor
            of risk (HR 1.53, p\&lt;0.001 in CODE 15\% test split). These results
            show that AI-enabled analysis of the ECG can add prognostic information
            to the interpretation of the 12-lead ECGs.

        abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely considered the primary test for
            evaluating cardiovascular diseases. However, the use of artificial intelligence
            to advance these medical practices and learn new clinical insights from
            ECGs remains largely unexplored. Utilising a dataset of 2,322,513 ECGs
            collected from 1,558,772 patients with 7 years of follow-up, we developed
            a deep learning model with state-of-the-art granularity for the interpretable
            diagnosis of cardiac abnormalities, gender identification, and hyper-
            tension screening solely from ECGs, which are then used to stratify the
            risk of mortality. The model achieved the area under the receiver operating
            characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.998 (95\% confidence interval (CI),
            0.995-0.999), 0.964 (0.963-0.965), and 0.839 (0.837-0.841) for the three
            diagnostic tasks separately. Using ECG-predicted results, we find high
            risks of mortality for subjects with sinus tachycardia (adjusted hazard
            ratio (HR) of 2.24, 1.96-2.57), and atrial fibrillation (adjusted HR of
            2.22, 1.99-2.48). We further use salient morphologies produced by the
            deep learning model to identify key ECG leads that achieved similar performance
            for the three diagnoses, and we find that the V1 ECG lead is important
            for hypertension screening and mortality risk stratification of hypertensive
            cohorts, with an AUC of 0.816 (0.814-0.818) and a univariate HR of 1.70
            (1.61-1.79) for the two tasks separately. Using ECGs alone, our developed
            model showed cardiologist-level accuracy in interpretable cardiac diagnosis,
            and the advancement in mortality risk stratification; In addition, the
            potential to facilitate clinical knowledge discovery for gender and hypertension
            detection which are not readily available.

            deep learning model to extract characteristics in electrocardiogram (ECG)
            and explore its usage in knowledge discovery. Utilising a 12-lead ECG
            dataset (nECGs = 2,322,513) collected from unique subjects (nSubjects
            = 1,558,772) in primary care, we performed three independent medical tasks
            with the proposed model: (i) cardiac abnormality diagnosis, (ii) gender
            identification, and (iii) hypertension screening. We achieved an area
            under the curve (AUC) score of 0.998 (95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.995-0.999),
            0.964 (95\% CI, 0.963-0.965), and 0.839 (95\% CI, 0.837-0.841) for each
            task, respectively; We provide interpretation of salient morphologies
            and further identified key ECG leads that achieve similar performance
            for the three tasks: (i) AVR and V1 leads (AUC=0.990 (95\% CI, 0.982-0.995);
            (ii) V5 lead (AUC=0.900 (95\% CI, 0.899-0.902)); and (iii) V1 lead (AUC=0.816
            (95\% CI, 0.814-0.818)). Using ECGs, our model not only has demonstrated
            cardiologist-level accuracy in heart diagnosis with interpretability,
            but also shows its potentials in facilitating clinical knowledge discovery
            for gender and hypertension detection which are not readily available.'

        title: Genetic and Phenotypic Architecture of Human Myocardial Trabeculation
        year: '2024'
        month: November
        journal: Nature Cardiovascular Research

        abstract: Cardiac trabeculae form a network of muscular strands that line
            the inner surfaces of the heart. Their development depends on multiscale
            morphogenetic processes and, while highly conserved across vertebrate
            evolution, their role in the pathophysiology of the mature heart is not
            fully understood. Here we report variant associations across the allele
            frequency spectrum for trabecular morphology in 47,803 participants of
            the UK Biobank using fractal dimension analysis of cardiac imaging. We
            identified an association between trabeculation and rare variants in 56
            genes that regulate myocardial contractility and ventricular development.
            Genome-wide association studies identified 68 loci in pathways that regulate
            sarcomeric function, differentiation of the conduction system and cell
            fate determination. We found that trabeculation-associated variants were
            modifiers of cardiomyopathy phenotypes with opposing effects in hypertrophic
            and dilated cardiomyopathy. Together, these data provide insights into
            mechanisms that regulate trabecular development and plasticity, and identify
            a potential role in modifying monogenic disease expression.

        abstract: 'In this work, we present a method to explain ``end-toend'''' electrocardiogram
            (ECG) signal classifiers, where the explanations were built along with
            seniors cardiologist to provide meaningful features to the final users.
            Our method focuses exclusively on automated ECG diagnosis and analyzes
            the explanation in terms of clinical accuracy for interpretability and
            robustness. The proposed method uses a noise-insertion strategy to quantify
            the impact of intervals and segments of the ECG signals on the automated
            classification outcome. An ECG segmentation method was applied to ECG
            tracings, to obtain: (1) Intervals, Segments and Axis; (2) Rate, and (3)
            Rhythm. Noise was added to the signal to disturb the ECG features in a
            realistic way. The method was tested using Monte Carlo simulation and
            the feature impact is estimated by the change in the model prediction
            averaged over 499 executions and a feature is defined as important if
            its mean value changes the result of the classifier. We demonstrate our
            method by explaining diagnoses generated by a deep convolutional neural
            network. The proposed method is particularly effective and useful for
            modern deep learning models that take raw data as input.'

        abstract: 'Introduction: Telehealth system is an important tool to improve
            access and quality to health assistance.Large electrocardiogram (ECG)
            databases, linked to mortality or hospitalization data, can be useful
            in determining the prognostic value of ECG markers. Atrial fibrillation
            (AF) is a public health problem with increasing prevalence as the population
            ages, associated with cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.Hypothesis:
            Evaluate the association between the presence of AF with overall and cardiovascular
            mortality in a large electronic cohort of primary care patients of Minas
            Gerais.Methods: This is an observational retrospective study. Patients
            over 16 years old who performed digital electrocardiograms by Telehealth
            Network of Minas Gerais from 2013 to 2016 were assessed. A probabilistic
            linkage between data from the national mortality information system and
            our ECG database was made. Clinical data were self-reported, and ECGs
            were interpreted by a team of trained cardiologists and automatic software
            (Glasgow and Minnesota).The diagnosis of AF was considered if there was
            concordance between the cardiologist{$\prime$}s report and one of the
            automatic systems. In cases of disagreement, ECGs were reviewed manually.Only
            the first ECG made was analysed. To assess the relation between AF and
            mortality, Cox regression was used, adjusted by age, sex and clinical
            conditions.Results: From a dataset of 1,773,689 patients, 1,075,531 were
            included. The mean age was 51.4 years, 40.5\% male.The prevalence of AF
            was 1.15\%. There were 2.9\% deaths for all causes in 2.69 years of mean
            follow up. In univariate analysis, AF was a risk factor for death from
            all causes (HR 6.98, 95\%CI 6.68-7.28). After adjustment for age, sex
            and comorbidities, AF remained an independent risk factor for all-cause
            mortality (HR 2.49; 95\% CI 2.39 - 2.61). AF was also a predictor of risk
            for cardiovascular mortality after adjustment for age, sex and clinical
            conditions (HR 2.35, 95\% CI 2.01-2.73). In multivariate analysis by sex,
            adjusted for age and comorbidities, AF women had higher risk of death
            for all causes (HR 3.06; 95\% CI 2.86-3.26) than men (HR 2.18; 95\% CI
            2.06-2.32). There were no difference between sex in cardiovascular mortality
            (HR 2.34; 95\% CI 2.01-2.73 for male sex e HR 2.49; 95\% CI 2.14-2.90
            for female).Conclusions: AF was a strong predictor of mortality for all
            causes and cardiovascular mortality in primary care population with increased
            risk in women for deaths for all cause.'

        abstract: 'Computerized electrocardiography (ECG) has been widely used and
            allows linkage to electronic medical records. The present study describes
            the development and clinical applications of an electronic cohort derived
            from a digital ECG database obtained by the Telehealth Network of Minas
            Gerais, Brazil, for the period 2010--2017, linked to the mortality data
            from the national information system, the Clinical Outcomes in Digital
            Electrocardiography (CODE) dataset. From 2,470,424 ECGs, 1,773,689 patients
            were identified. A total of 1,666,778 (94\%) underwent a valid ECG recording
            for the period 2010 to 2017, with 1,558,421 patients over 16 years old;
            40.2\% were men, with a mean age of 51.7 [SD 17.6] years. During a mean
            follow-up of 3.7 years, the mortality rate was 3.3\%. ECG abnormalities
            assessed were: atrial fibrillation (AF), right bundle branch block (RBBB),
            left bundle branch block (LBBB), atrioventricular block (AVB), and ventricular
            pre-excitation. Most ECG abnormalities (AF: Hazard ratio [HR] 2.10; 95\%
            CI 2.03--2.17; RBBB: HR 1.32; 95\%CI 1.27--1.36; LBBB: HR 1.69; 95\% CI
            1.62--1.76; first degree AVB: Relative survival [RS]: 0.76; 95\% CI0.71--0.81;
            2:1 AVB: RS 0.21 95\% CI0.09--0.52; and RS 0.36; third degree AVB: 95\%
            CI 0.26--0.49) were predictors of overall mortality, except for ventricular
            pre-excitation (HR 1.41; 95\% CI 0.56--3.57) and Mobitz I AVB (RS 0.65;
            95\% CI 0.34--1.24). In conclusion, a large ECG database established by
            a telehealth network can be a useful tool for facilitating new advances
            in the fields of digital electrocardiography, clinical cardiology and
            cardiovascular epidemiology.'

        abstract: 'Methods: This observational retrospective study of primary care
            patients was developed with the digital ECG database from the Telehealth
            Network of Minas Gerais, Brazil. ECGs performed from 2010 to 2017 were
            interpreted by cardiologists and the University of Glasgow automated analysis
            software. An electronic cohort was obtained linking data from ECG exams
            and those from a national mortality information system, using standard
            probabilistic linkage methods. We considered only the first ECG of each
            patient. Patients under 16 years were excluded. Hazard ratios (HR) for
            mortality were adjusted for demographic and self-reported clinical factors
            and estimated with Cox regression. Results: From a dataset of 1,773,689
            patients, 1,558,421 were included, mean age 51.6 years; 40.2\% male. There
            were 3.34\% deaths from all causes in 3.68 years of median follow up.
            The prevalence of AF was 1.33\%. AF was an independent risk factor for
            all-cause mortality (HR 2.10, 95\%CI 2.03--2.17) and cardiovascular mortality
            (HR 2.06, 95\%CI 1.86--2.29). Females with AF had a higher risk of overall
            and cardiovascular mortality compared with males (p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusions:
            AF was a strong predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in
            a primary care population, with increased risk in women.'

        abstract: 'Introduction: Aging affects the electrocardiogram (ECG) with a
            higher incidence of abnormalities in older patients. ECG-age can be predicted
            by artificial intelligence (AI) and can be used as a measure of cardiovascular
            health.Hypothesis: ECG-age predicted by AI is a risk factor for overall
            mortality.Methods: The Clinical Outcomes in Digital Electrocardiography
            (CODE) study is a retrospective cohort with a mean follow-up of 3.67 years.The
            dataset consists of Brazilian patients, mainly from primary care centers.
            Two established cohorts, ELSA-Brasil, of Brazilian public servants, and
            SaMi-Trop, of Chagas disease patients, were used for external validation.
            2,322,513 ECGs from 1,558,421 patients over 16 years old that underwent
            an ECG from 2010 to 2017 were included. A deep convolutional neural network
            was trained in order to predict the age of the patient based solely on
            ECG 12-lead tracings. The ECG database was split into 85-15\% training
            and test datasets, respectively. Death was ascertained using probabilistic
            linkage with Brazil{$\prime$}s mortality information data. The Cox regression
            model, adjusted by age and sex, was used for statistical analysis. The
            model was validated in two cohorts: ELSA-Brasil (n=14,263) and SaMi-Trop
            (n=1,631).Results: he mean predicted ECG-age was 52.0 years ({\textpm}18.7)
            with a mean absolute error of 8.38 ({\textpm}7.0) years. Patients with
            ECG-age {$>$}8y older than chronological age had higher mortality rate
            (HR 1.79, 95\%CI 1.69-1.90; p{$<$}0.001), whereas those ECG-age {$>$}8y
            younger than chronological age were associated with a lower mortality
            rate (HR 0.78, 95\%CI 0.74-0.83; p{$<$}0.001). These results were similar
            in ELSA-Brasil and SaMi-Trop external validation cohorts (HR 1.75, 95\%CI
            1.35-2.27; p{$<$}0.001;HR 2.42, 95\%CI 1.53-3.83; p{$<$}0.001 for {$>$}8y
            difference, retrospectively; HR 0.74, 95\%CI 0.63-0.88; p{$<$}0.001;HR
            0.89, 95\%CI 0.52-1.54; p=0.68 for {$<$}8y difference, respectively).Conclusions:
            ECG-age, predicted by AI, can be useful as a tool for risk stratification
            of mortality.'

        abstract: Cross-validation is commonly used to estimate machine learning model
            performance on new samples. However, using it for both hyperparameter
            selection and error estimation can lead to overestimating model performance,
            especially with extensive hyperparameter searches that overly tailor models
            to validation data. We demonstrate that deep learning further amplifies
            this bias, with even minor model adjustments causing significant overestimation.
            Our extensive experiments on simulated and real data focus on the bias
            from early stopping during cross-validation. We find that overestimation
            intensifies with network depth and is especially severe in small datasets,
            which are common in physiological signal processing applications. Selecting
            the early stopping point during cross-validation can result in ROC-AUC
            estimates exceeding 90{\textbackslash}\% on random data, and this effect
            persists across various sample sizes, architectures, and network sizes.

        abstract: Decoding visual images from brain activity has significant potential
            for advancing brain-computer interaction and enhancing the understanding
            of human perception. Recent approaches align the representation spaces
            of images and brain activity to enable visual decoding. In this paper,
            we introduce the use of human-aligned image encoders to map brain signals
            to images. We hypothesize that these models more effectively capture perceptual
            attributes associated with the rapid visual stimuli presentations commonly
            used in visual brain data recording experiments. Our empirical results
            support this hypothesis, demonstrating that this simple modification improves
            image retrieval accuracy by up to 21\% compared to state-of-the-art methods.
            Comprehensive experiments confirm consistent performance improvements
            across diverse EEG architectures, image encoders, alignment methods, participants,
            and brain imaging modalities.

        abstract: 'This editorial refers to `Artificial intelligence--derived electrocardiographic
            aging and risk of atrial fibrillation: a multi-national study'', by S.
            Cho et al., https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae790.Ageing is a complex,
            multifaceted process encompassing biological, physiological, and psychosocial
            changes occurring over time. At the cellular and molecular levels, ageing
            is characterized by accumulating damage in cells and tissues, leading
            to a progressive decline in the body''s ability to maintain homeostasis
            and repair itself. This biological deterioration is not uniform across
            individuals or even within different organs of the same individual. While
            some organs may exhibit accelerated ageing, others might remain relatively
            preserved, highlighting the heterogeneity of the ageing process across
            the human body.1 The concept of `biological age'' vs. `chronological age''
            is pivotal in understanding ageing. Chronological age is a simple measure
            of the years a person has lived, whereas biological age reflects the functional
            status and health of an individual''s organs and systems. Individuals
            of the same chronological age may have vastly different biological ages
            due to genetic predisposition, lifestyle factors, and environmental exposures.
            This variation can significantly impact disease risk and mortality. Understanding
            and measuring organ-specific ageing can open up avenues for targeted interventions
            that could decelerate ageing in specific organs, thereby improving overall
            health and extending a healthy life span.2'

            a {{Deep Convolutional Network}}

        journal: Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) Workshop at NeurIPS

        abstract: We present a model for predicting electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities
            in short-duration 12-lead ECG signals which outperformed medical doctors
            on the 4th year of their cardiology residency. Such exams can provide
            a full evaluation of heart activity and have not been studied in previous
            end-to-end machine learning papers. Using the database of a large telehealth
            network, we built a novel dataset with more than 2 million ECG tracings,
            orders of magnitude larger than those used in previous studies. Moreover,
            our dataset is more realistic, as it consist of 12-lead ECGs recorded
            during standard in-clinics exams. Using this data, we trained a residual
            neural network with 9 convolutional layers to map 7 to 10 second ECG signals
            to 6 classes of ECG abnormalities. Future work should extend these results
            to cover a large range of ECG abnormalities, which could improve the accessibility
            of this diagnostic tool and avoid wrong diagnosis from medical doctors.

            Ensemble
        year: '2020'
        journal: Computing in Cardiology (CinC)
        doi: 10.22489/CinC.2020.130
        abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a major diagnostic test for
            cardiovascular diseases and enhanced automated analysis tools might lead
            to more reliable diagnosis and improved clinical practice. Deep neural
            networks are models composed of stacked transformations that learn tasks
            by examples. Inspired by the success of these models in computer vision,
            we propose an end-to-end approach for the task at hand. We trained deep
            convolutional neural network models in the heterogeneous dataset provided
            in the Physionet 2020 Challenge and used an ensemble of seven of these
            convolutional models for the classification of abnormalities present in
            the ECG records. Ensembles use the output of multiple models to generate
            a combined prediction and are known to improve performance and generalization
            when compared to the individual models. In our submission, we use an ensemble
            of neural networks with the architecture similar to the one described
            in Nat Commun 11, 1760 (2020) for 12-lead ECGs classification. On the
            partially hidden test dataset from the challenge, the best-scored entry
            for our team (the ``Code Team'') had a performance of 0.657, which place
            us in the 7-th place team-wise in the challenge leaderboard.

        abstract: Adversarial training can be used to learn models that are robust
            against perturbations. For linear models, it can be formulated as a convex
            optimization problem. Compared to methods proposed in the context of deep
            learning, leveraging the optimization structure allows significantly faster
            convergence rates. Still, the use of generic convex solvers can be inefficient
            for large-scale problems. Here, we propose tailored optimization algorithms
            for the adversarial training of linear models, which render large-scale
            regression and classification problems more tractable. For regression
            problems, we propose a family of solvers based on iterative ridge regression
            and, for classification, a family of solvers based on projected gradient
            descent. The methods are based on extended variable reformulations of
            the original problem. We illustrate their efficiency in numerical examples.

        address: Belo Horizonte, Brazil
        abstract: 'A stereo camera is a camera that simultaneously captures two or
            more images in order to estimate depth. A stereo camera prototype was
            implemented using two image sensors. Its project was based on v200, a
            commercial camera produced by Invent Vision (iVision), company for which
            this prototype was developed. The major steps needed to estimate depth
            using a stereo camera were followed. They are: calibration (estimation
            of camera geometry and parameters), retification (aligning images), correspondence
            (finding correspondent points on the two images and the distance between
            them) and reconstruction (estimation of features depth using triangulation).
            All algorithms needed were implemented using C++ and integrated to the
            prototype. The prototype is able to estimate depth in a range of 0.7 to
            20 meters, it has a resolution on the order of a few centimeters and can
            reach a frame rate of 5 frames per second. The industrial camera v200
            has all its internal processing computed by a FPGA. It is suggested, as
            a future work, to use the FPGA to speed up the retification and correspondence
            algorithms. The aim of this work was to take a first step towards a stereo
            camera based on v200 to be a competitive commercial product, apt to be
            sold by iVision.'

        abstract: As machine learning models start to be used in critical applications,
            their vulnerabilities and brittleness become a pressing concern. Adversarial
            attacks are a popular framework for studying these vulnerabilities. In
            this work, we study the error of linear regression in the face of adversarial
            attacks. We provide bounds of the error in terms of the traditional risk
            and the parameter norm and show how these bounds can be leveraged and
            make it possible to use analysis from non-adversarial setups to study
            the adversarial risk. The usefulness of these results is illustrated by
            shedding light on whether or not overparameterized linear models can be
            adversarially robust. We show that adding features to linear models might
            be either a source of additional robustness or brittleness. We show that
            these differences appear due to scaling and how the \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$
            and \${\textbackslash}ell\_2\$ norms of random projections concentrate.
            We also show how the reformulation we propose allows for solving adversarial
            training as a convex optimization problem. This is then used as a tool
            to study how adversarial training and other regularization methods might
            affect the robustness of the estimated models.

        abstract: 'Neural network models for dynamic systems can be trained either
            in parallel or in series-parallel configurations. Influenced by early
            arguments, several papers justify the choice of series-parallel rather
            than parallel configuration claiming it has a lower computational cost,
            better stability properties during training and provides more accurate
            results. Other published results, on the other hand, defend parallel training
            as being more robust and capable of yielding more accurate long-term predictions.
            The main contribution of this paper is to present a study comparing both
            methods under the same unified framework with special attention to three
            aspects: (i)~robustness of the estimation in the presence of noise; (ii)~computational
            cost; and, (iii)~convergence. A unifying mathematical framework and simulation
            studies show situations where each training method provides superior validation
            results and suggest that parallel training is generally better in more
            realistic scenarios. An example using measured data seems to reinforce
            such a claim. Complexity analysis and numerical examples show that both
            methods have similar computational cost although series-parallel training
            is more amenable to parallelization. Some informal discussion about stability
            and convergence properties is presented and explored in the examples.'

        abstract: This paper studies parameter estimation of output error (OE) models.
            The commonly used approach of minimizing the free-run simulation error
            is called single shooting in contrast with the new multiple shooting approach
            proposed in this paper, for which the free-run simulation error of sub-datasets
            is minimized subject to equality constraints. The names ``single shooting''
            and ``multiple shooting'' are used due to the similarities with techniques
            for estimating ODE (ordinary differential equation) parameters. Examples
            with nonlinear polynomial models illustrate the advantages of OE models
            as well as the capability of the multiple shooting approach to avoid undesirable
            local minima.

        doi: 10.1016/j.automatica.2020.109158
        abstract: We shed new light on the smoothness of optimization problems arising
            in prediction error parameter estimation of linear and nonlinear systems.
            We show that for regions of the parameter space where the model is not
            contractive, the Lipschitz constant and beta-smoothness of the objective
            function might blow up exponentially with the simulation length, making
            it hard to numerically find minima within those regions or, even, to escape
            from them. In addition to providing theoretical understanding of this
            problem, this paper also proposes the use of multiple shooting as a viable
            solution. The proposed method minimizes the error between a prediction
            model and the observed values. Rather than running the prediction model
            over the entire dataset, multiple shooting splits the data into smaller
            subsets and runs the prediction model over each subset, making the simulation
            length a design parameter and making it possible to solve problems that
            would be infeasible using a standard approach. The equivalence to the
            original problem is obtained by including constraints in the optimization.
            The new method is illustrated by estimating the parameters of nonlinear
            systems with chaotic or unstable behavior, as well as neural networks.
            We also present a comparative analysis of the proposed method with multi-step-ahead
            prediction error minimization.

        abstract: State-of-the-art machine learning models can be vulnerable to very
            small input perturbations that are adversarially constructed. Adversarial
            training is one of the most effective approaches to defend against such
            examples. We show that for linear regression problems, adversarial training
            can be formulated as a convex problem. This fact is then used to show
            that \${\textbackslash}ell\_{\textbackslash}infty\$-adversarial training
            produces sparse solutions and has many similarities to the lasso method.
            Similarly, \${\textbackslash}ell\_2\$-adversarial training has similarities
            with ridge regression. We use a robust regression framework to analyze
            and understand these similarities and also point to some differences.
            Finally, we show how adversarial training behaves differently from other
            regularization methods when estimating overparameterized models (i.e.,
            models with more parameters than datapoints). It minimizes a sum of three
            terms which regularizes the solution, but unlike lasso and ridge regression,
            it can sharply transition into an interpolation mode. We show that for
            sufficiently many features or sufficiently small regularization parameters,
            the learned model perfectly interpolates the training data while still
            exhibiting good out-of-sample performance.

        abstract: Digital electrocardiographs are now widely available and a large
            number of digital electrocardiograms (ECGs) have been recorded and stored.
            The present study describes the development and clinical applications
            of a large database of such digital ECGs, namely the CODE (Clinical Outcomes
            in Digital Electrocardiology) study. ECGs obtained by the Telehealth Network
            of Minas Gerais, Brazil, from 2010 to 17, were organized in a structured
            database. A hierarchical free-text machine learning algorithm recognized
            specific ECG diagnoses from cardiologist reports. The Glasgow ECG Analysis
            Program provided Minnesota Codes and automatic diagnostic statements.
            The presence of a specific ECG abnormality was considered when both automatic
            and medical diagnosis were concordant; cases of discordance were decided
            using heuristisc rules and manual review. The ECG database was linked
            to the national mortality information system using probabilistic linkage
            methods. From 2,470,424 ECGs, 1,773,689 patients were identified. After
            excluding the ECGs with technical problems and patients {$<$}16\,years-old,
            1,558,415 patients were studied. High performance measures were obtained
            using an end-to-end deep neural network trained to detect 6 types of ECG
            abnormalities, with F1 scores {$>$}80\% and specificity {$>$}99\% in an
            independent test dataset. We also evaluated the risk of mortality associated
            with the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF), which showed that AF was
            a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality and mortality for all causes,
            with increased risk in women. In conclusion, a large database that comprises
            all ECGs performed by a large telehealth network can be useful for further
            developments in the field of digital electrocardiography, clinical cardiology
            and cardiovascular epidemiology.

        title: Detection of {{Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction}} from {{Electrocardiographic
            Images}}

        journal: Circulation
        doi: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.062646
        abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction is associated
            with a {$>$}8-fold increased risk of heart failure and a 2-fold risk of
            premature death. The use of ECG signals in screening for LV systolic dysfunction
            is limited by their availability to clinicians. We developed a novel deep
            learning--based approach that can use ECG images for the screening of
            LV systolic dysfunction. METHODS: Using 12-lead ECGs plotted in multiple
            different formats, and corresponding echocardiographic data recorded within
            15 days from the Yale New Haven Hospital between 2015 and 2021, we developed
            a convolutional neural network algorithm to detect an LV ejection fraction
            {$<$}40\%. The model was validated within clinical settings at Yale New
            Haven Hospital and externally on ECG images from Cedars Sinai Medical
            Center in Los Angeles, CA; Lake Regional Hospital in Osage Beach, MO;
            Memorial Hermann Southeast Hospital in Houston, TX; and Methodist Cardiology
            Clinic of San Antonio, TX. In addition, it was validated in the prospective
            Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health. Gradient-weighted class
            activation mapping was used to localize class-discriminating signals in
            ECG images. RESULTS: Overall, 385\,601 ECGs with paired echocardiograms
            were used for model development. The model demonstrated high discrimination
            power across various ECG image formats and calibrations in internal validation
            (area under receiving operation characteristics [AUROCs], 0.91; area under
            precision-recall curve [AUPRC], 0.55); and external sets of ECG images
            from Cedars Sinai (AUROC, 0.90 and AUPRC, 0.53), outpatient Yale New Haven
            Hospital clinics (AUROC, 0.94 and AUPRC, 0.77), Lake Regional Hospital
            (AUROC, 0.90 and AUPRC, 0.88), Memorial Hermann Southeast Hospital (AUROC,
            0.91 and AUPRC 0.88), Methodist Cardiology Clinic (AUROC, 0.90 and AUPRC,
            0.74), and Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health cohort (AUROC,
            0.95 and AUPRC, 0.45). An ECG suggestive of LV systolic dysfunction portended
            a {$>$}27-fold higher odds of LV systolic dysfunction on transthoracic
            echocardiogram (odds ratio, 27.5 [95\% CI, 22.3--33.9] in the held-out
            set). Class-discriminative patterns localized to the anterior and anteroseptal
            leads (V2 to V3), corresponding to the left ventricle regardless of the
            ECG layout. A positive ECG screen in individuals with an LV ejection fraction
            {$\geq$}40\% at the time of initial assessment was associated with a 3.9-fold
            increased risk of developing incident LV systolic dysfunction in the future
            (hazard ratio, 3.9 [95\% CI, 3.3--4.7]; median follow-up, 3.2 years).
            CONCLUSIONS: We developed and externally validated a deep learning model
            that identifies LV systolic dysfunction from ECG images. This approach
            represents an automated and accessible screening strategy for LV systolic
            dysfunction, particularly in low-resource settings.'

        abstract: Background and Aims Artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiograms
            (AI-ECG) can be used to predict risk of future disease and mortality but
            has not yet been adopted into clinical practice. Existing model predictions
            lack actionability at an individual patient level, explainability and
            biological plausibility. We sought to address these limitations of previous
            AI-ECG approaches by developing the AI-ECG risk estimator (AIRE) platform.
            Methods and Results The AIRE platform was developed in a secondary care
            dataset of 1,163,401 ECGs from 189,539 patients, using deep learning with
            a discrete-time survival model to create a subject-specific survival curve
            using a single ECG. Therefore, AIRE predicts not only risk of mortality,
            but time-to-mortality. AIRE was validated in five diverse, transnational
            cohorts from the USA, Brazil and the UK, including volunteers, primary
            care and secondary care subjects. AIRE accurately predicts risk of all-cause
            mortality (C-index 0.775 (0.773-0.776)), cardiovascular (CV) death 0.832
            (0.831-0.834), non-CV death (0.749 (0.747-0.751)), future ventricular
            arrhythmia (0.760 (0.756-0.763)), future atherosclerotic cardiovascular
            disease (0.696 (0.694-0.698)) and future heart failure (0.787 (0.785-0.889))).
            Through phenome- and genome-wide association studies, we identified candidate
            biological pathways for the prediction of increased risk, including changes
            in cardiac structure and function, and genes associated with cardiac structure,
            biological aging and metabolic syndrome. Conclusion AIRE is an actionable,
            explainable and biologically plausible AI-ECG risk estimation platform
            that has the potential for use worldwide across a wide range of clinical
            contexts for short- and long-term risk estimation. {$<$}img class="highwire-fragment

        abstract: Background Females are typically underserved in cardiovascular medicine.
            The use of sex as a dichotomous variable for risk stratification fails
            to capture the heterogeneity of risk within each sex. We aimed to develop
            an artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiography (AI-ECG) model
            to investigate sex-specific cardiovascular risk. Methods In this retrospective
            cohort study, we trained a convolutional neural network to classify sex
            using the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). The Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
            Center (BIDMC) secondary care dataset, comprising data from individuals
            who had clinically indicated ECGs performed in a hospital setting in Boston,
            MA, USA collected between May, 2000, and March, 2023, was the derivation
            cohort (1\hphantom{,}163\hphantom{,}401 ECGs). 50\% of this dataset was
            used for model training, 10\% for validation, and 40\% for testing. External
            validation was performed using the UK Biobank cohort, comprising data
            from volunteers aged 40--69 years at the time of enrolment in 2006--10
            (42\hphantom{,}386 ECGs). We examined the difference between AI-ECG-predicted
            sex (continuous) and biological sex (dichotomous), termed sex discordance
            score. Findings AI-ECG accurately identified sex (area under the receiver
            operating characteristic 0{$\cdot$}943 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}942--0{$\cdot$}943]
            for BIDMC and 0{$\cdot$}971 [0{$\cdot$}969--0{$\cdot$}972] for the UK
            Biobank). In BIDMC outpatients with normal ECGs, an increased sex discordance
            score was associated with covariate-adjusted increased risk of cardiovascular
            death in females (hazard ratio [HR] 1{$\cdot$}78 [95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}18--2{$\cdot$}70],
            p=0{$\cdot$}006) but not males (1{$\cdot$}00 [0{$\cdot$}63--1{$\cdot$}58],
            p=0{$\cdot$}996). In the UK Biobank cohort, the same pattern was seen
            (HR 1{$\cdot$}33 [95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}06--1{$\cdot$}68] for females, p=0{$\cdot$}015;
            0{$\cdot$}98 [0{$\cdot$}80--1{$\cdot$}20] for males, p=0{$\cdot$}854).
            Females with a higher sex discordance score were more likely to have future
            heart failure or myocardial infarction in the BIDMC cohort and had more
            male cardiac (increased left ventricular mass and chamber volumes) and
            non-cardiac phenotypes (increased muscle mass and reduced body fat percentage)
            in both cohorts. Interpretation Sex discordance score is a novel AI-ECG
            biomarker capable of identifying females with disproportionately elevated
            cardiovascular risk. AI-ECG has the potential to identify female patients
            who could benefit from enhanced risk factor modification or surveillance.

        title: A Comparison of Artificial Intelligence-Enhanced Electrocardiography
            Approaches for Prediction of Time-to-Mortality Using Electrocardiogram
            Images
        year: '2024'

        abstract: Most artificial intelligence-enhanced ECG (AI-ECG) models used to
            predict adverse events including death require that the ECGs be stored
            digitally. However, the majority of clinical facilities worldwide store
            ECGs as images.1,163,401 ECGs (189,539 patients) from a secondary care
            dataset were available as both natively digital traces and PDF images.
            A digitisation pipeline extracted signals from PDFs. Separate 1D convolutional
            neural network (CNN) models were trained on natively digital or digitised
            ECGs, with a discrete-time survival loss function to predict time-to-mortality.
            A 2D CNN model was trained on 310x868 pixel ECG images. External validation
            was performed in 958,954 ECGs (645,373 patients) from a Brazilian primary
            care cohort and 1022 ECGs (1022 patients) from a Chagas disease cohort.The
            image 2D CNN model and digitised 1D CNN model performed comparably to
            natively digital 1D CNN model in internal (C-index 0.780 (0.779-0.781),
            0.772 (0.771-0.774) and 0.775 (0.774-0.776 respectively) and external
            validation. Models trained on natively digital 1D ECGs had comparable
            performance when applied to digitised 1D ECGs (C-index 0.773 (0.771-0.774).Both
            the image 2D CNN and digitised 1D CNN enable mortality prediction from
            ECG images, with comparable performance to natively digital 1D CNN. Models
            trained on natively digital 1D ECGs can also be applied to digitised 1D
            ECGs, without any significant loss in performance. This works allows AI-ECG
            mortality prediction to be applied in diverse global settings lacking
            digital ECG infrastructure.

        abstract: SciPy is an open source scientific computing library for the Python
            programming language. SciPy 1.0 was released in late 2017, about 16 years
            after the original version 0.1 release. SciPy has become a de facto standard
            for leveraging scientific algorithms in the Python programming language,
            with more than 600 unique code contributors, thousands of dependent packages,
            over 100,000 dependent repositories, and millions of downloads per year.
            This includes usage of SciPy in almost half of all machine learning projects
            on GitHub, and usage by high profile projects including LIGO gravitational
            wave analysis and creation of the first-ever image of a black hole (M87).
            The library includes functionality spanning clustering, Fourier transforms,
            integration, interpolation, file I/O, linear algebra, image processing,
            orthogonal distance regression, minimization algorithms, signal processing,
            sparse matrix handling, computational geometry, and statistics. In this
            work, we provide an overview of the capabilities and development practices
            of the SciPy library and highlight some recent technical developments.

            Prediction
        year: '2024'
        journal: Scientific Reports
        volume: '14'
        number: '15273'

        doi: 10.1038/s41598-024-65223-w
        abstract: Imbalances in electrolyte concentrations can have severe consequences,
            but accurate and accessible measurements could improve patient outcomes.
            The current measurement method based on blood tests is accurate but invasive
            and time-consuming and is often unavailable for example in remote locations
            or an ambulance setting. In this paper, we explore the use of deep neural
            networks (DNNs) for regression tasks to accurately predict continuous
            electrolyte concentrations from electrocardiograms (ECGs), a quick and
            widely adopted tool. We analyze our DNN models on a novel dataset of over
            290,000 ECGs across four major electrolytes and compare their performance
            with traditional machine learning models. For improved understanding,
            we also study the full spectrum from continuous predictions to a binary
            classification of extreme concentration levels. Finally, we investigate
            probabilistic regression approaches and explore uncertainty estimates
            for enhanced clinical usefulness. Our results show that DNNs outperform
            traditional models but model performance varies significantly across different
            electrolytes. While discretization leads to good classification performance,
            it does not address the original problem of continuous concentration level
            prediction. Probabilistic regression has practical potential, but our
            uncertainty estimates are not perfectly calibrated. Our study is therefore
            a first step towards developing an accurate and reliable ECG-based method
            for electrolyte concentration level prediction---a method with high potential
            impact within multiple clinical scenarios.

        abstract: 'Objective: Over the past few years, deep learning (DL) has been
            used extensively in research for 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis.
            However, it is unclear whether the explicit or implicit claims made on
            DL superiority to the more classical feature engineering (FE) approaches,
            based on domain knowledge, hold. In addition, it remains unclear whether
            combining DL with FE may improve performance over a single modality. Methods:
            To address these research gaps and in-line with recent major experiments,
            we revisited three tasks: cardiac arrhythmia diagnosis (multiclass-multilabel
            classification), atrial fibrillation risk prediction (binary classification),
            and age estimation (regression). We used an overall dataset of 2.3M 12-lead
            ECG recordings to train the following models for each task: i) a random
            forest taking FE as input; ii) an end-to-end DL model; and iii) a merged
            model of FE+DL. Results: FE yielded comparable results to DL while necessitating
            significantly less data for the two classification tasks. DL outperformed
            FE for the regression task. For all tasks, merging FE with DL did not
            improve performance over DL alone. These findings were confirmed on the
            additional PTB-XL dataset. Conclusion: We found that for traditional 12-lead
            ECG based diagnosis tasks, DL did not yield a meaningful improvement over
            FE, while it improved significantly the nontraditional regression task.
            We also found that combining FE with DL did not improve over DL alone,
            which suggests that the FE were redundant with the features learned by
            DL. Significance: Our findings provides important recommendations on 12-lead
            ECG based machine learning strategy and data regime to choose for a given
            task. When looking at maximizing performance as the end goal, if the task
            is nontraditional and a large dataset is available then DL is preferable.
            If the task is a classical one and/or a small dataset is available then
            a FE approach may be the better choice.'
